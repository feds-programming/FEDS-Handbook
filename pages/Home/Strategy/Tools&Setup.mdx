## Evolution of Our Scouting Systems

### Pre-2021: The Paper Era

Before 2021, our team relied on a paper-based scouting system where team members specialized in monitoring specific robots and their capabilities.

## 2021-2022 Season: Foundation Building

<Tabs items={['Mk1: Google Sheets', 'Mk2: SPAMalytics']}>
  <Tab>
    #### System Components
    - Google Sheets for data storage
    - Paper-based field scouting
    - WIFI connectivity

    #### Advantages
    - Collaborative editing capabilities
    - Accessible to all team members

    #### Challenges
    - Performance issues with large datasets
    - Reliability concerns
    - Significant data loss incidents
    - Limited practical application beyond pick lists

    ðŸ’¡ **Development Needs Identified:**
    - Faster data collection methods
    - Improved data visualization tools

    #### Implementation Experience
    Our first digital scouting system began at Stoney Creek competition with paper-based data collection. The system suffered from accuracy issues and the manual data entry process was time-consuming. Despite having RCS WIFI access, we ultimately had to prioritize high-performing robots due to time constraints. The slow reference capabilities negatively impacted our picklist development process.

    This experience highlighted the need for automation, inspired by observations of other teams using technology-enhanced scouting methods.

  <Tab>
    #### System Components
    - Excel-based SPAMalytics platform
    - Paper data collection
    - Offline functionality

    #### Improvements
    - Significantly enhanced processing speed
    - Improved data reliability
    - Better synchronization with match progression

    #### Implementation Experience
    At the Lansing competition, we discovered and implemented team 180 S.P.A.M's Excel-based scouting system. This improved our data entry efficiency considerably, allowing near real-time match data updates. While data accuracy remained a concern, we successfully identified underrated teams for alliance selection. Our limited ability to assess defensive capabilities meant we relied on observation-based assessments for defensive robot selection.

    The scouting system contributed significantly to our success at Lansing, though we recognized the need for further automation and reduction in paper usage. At the State competition, we were unable to manage the data volume with our existing system.

## 2022-2023 Season: Digital Transformation

#### System Development Team
**Development Team:** Zayn, Sukhesh, Adit, Timothy, and Andrew Salmonson designed the system architecture. Multiple approaches were considered, including Michael Kaatz's bitfield/bitmask method for data compartmentalization, though this was ultimately not implemented in favor of a solution supporting textual data alongside numerical information.

- Leadership role assignments
- Resource allocation plan

[Retreat Documentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z7nvr7H0BCiZ4MzO2r3jO8Y8GbXoR8SS3ddACSCpWn0/edit#slide=id.g2a854d0a270_1_358)

#### New Application Architecture (2024)

**Core Objective**
Develop a sustainable scouting system requiring minimal specialized knowledge, featuring a template-based design compatible with Tableau visualization.

**Data Flow Design**
- **Template Categories:** Match, pit, and alliance scouting
- **Transfer Mechanism:** QR-encoded CSV files
- **Analysis Platform:** Tableau processing

**Conceptual Model**
Application inspired by [FRC Scouter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercilex.robotscouter) with customizable template functionality.

**Development Lead:** Ritesh Raj
