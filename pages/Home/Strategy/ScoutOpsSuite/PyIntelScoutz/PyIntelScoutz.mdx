## Application Workflow

### 1. Startup and Data Loading

When the application starts:
1. A welcome screen with ASCII art is displayed
2. The application checks for existing data in the default directory
3. Users are prompted to select a data source (CSV, JSON, or QR code data)
4. Data is loaded and validated

### 2. Data Processing

Once data is loaded:
1. Boolean values are normalized to handle various representations (TRUE, Yes, 1, T)
2. Team numbers are converted to strings for consistent processing
3. Phase scores are calculated based on game-specific formulas
4. Data is aggregated by team with statistical measures (mean, std, max)
5. Derived metrics (consistency, climbing percentage) are calculated
6. Team profiles are generated with comprehensive statistics

### 3. Analysis Menu

The main analysis menu provides these options:
1. View Team List - Display all teams with their performance metrics
2. View Alliance Recommendations - Generate alliance selection suggestions
3. Export Strategy Report - Create a comprehensive Markdown report
4. Generate Performance Visualization - Create performance charts
5. Predict Match Outcome (Basic) - Simple statistical prediction
6. Predict Match Outcome (ML-Based) - Advanced ML-based prediction
7. Manage Team Filters - Add/remove teams from analysis
8. Search Teams - Find teams based on specific criteria
9. Train Match Prediction Model - Create/update the ML model
10. Update Data Files - Manage scouting data files
11. Team Lookup - Detailed information on specific teams

### 4. Machine Learning Pipeline

The ML-based prediction follows this workflow:
1. Data preparation (feature selection, splitting into train/test)
2. Model training using XGBoost (n_estimators=200, max_depth=6)
3. Cross-validation (5-fold) to assess model quality
4. Model evaluation using accuracy metrics and classification report
5. Model persistence to disk for future predictions
6. Prediction using team features for match outcome probability

### 5. Team Analysis Features

#### Alliance Selection
Helps teams select alliance partners by identifying:
- Best autonomous teams
- Best teleop teams
- Best endgame teams
- Best defense teams
- Most consistent teams
- Most versatile teams (appearing in multiple strength categories)

#### Team Filtering
Allows users to:
- Add specific teams to a filtered list
- Remove teams from the filtered list
- Clear all team filters
- Regenerate analysis without filtered teams

#### Team Lookup
Provides detailed team information:
- Match statistics and performance metrics
- Comment sentiment analysis (positive/negative)
- External data from Statbotics and The Blue Alliance

## Application Data Directory

PyIntel Scoutz stores data in a platform-specific location:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Local\ScoutOps\`
- Other platforms: `~/.scoutops/`

This directory contains:
- Unified QR code scanner data
- Trained machine learning models
- Backup files of original data

## User Interface

The application uses a terminal-based UI with:
- Color-coded text for easy reading
- Tables for structured data display
- Panels for grouped information
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Interactive prompts for user input

## Sample Session

A typical usage session might look like:

1. Start the application
2. Load scouting data from CSV files
3. View the team list to get an overview
4. Generate alliance recommendations
5. Use the match predictor to simulate potential matches
6. Export a strategy report for the drive team
7. Generate visualizations for team presentation

## Conclusion

PyIntel Scoutz combines data analysis, machine learning, and visualization to provide FRC teams with powerful scouting insights. Its modular architecture and comprehensive feature set make it a valuable tool for strategic decision-making during competitions.
