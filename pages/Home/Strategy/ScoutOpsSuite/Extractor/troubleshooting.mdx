# Scout Ops Extractor Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses common issues that may arise when using Scout Ops Extractor and provides solutions to resolve them.

## Connection Issues

### API Connection Failures

**Symptoms:** "Error: Connection failed" or timeout messages when trying to fetch data.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Check internet connection:** Ensure your device has a stable internet connection.
2. **Verify API key:** Confirm your Blue Alliance API key is entered correctly and is still valid.
3. **Check service status:** The Blue Alliance or Statbotics servers might be down. Check their status pages or try again later.
4. **Firewall/proxy issues:** If using Scout Ops Extractor in a restricted network environment (like a school), firewall rules might be blocking API connections.

```python
# Test TBA API connection
import requests
response = requests.get("https://www.thebluealliance.com/api/v3/status", 
                       headers={"X-TBA-Auth-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"})
print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")
print(f"Response: {response.text}")
```

### Data Not Loading Completely

**Symptoms:** Partial data loaded, missing teams or matches, or empty fields in exports.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Check event key format:** Ensure the event key follows the correct format (year + event code, e.g., "2025miket").
2. **Wait for event data to be published:** Data might not be available yet on TBA, especially for ongoing or future events.
3. **Try alternative endpoints:** If match data is unavailable, team data might still be accessible.

## Application Issues

### Application Crashes on Launch

**Symptoms:** The application closes immediately after opening or displays a brief error message.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Check Python version:** Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. **Reinstall dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again to ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
3. **Check permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the application and write to the output directories.
4. **Launch from command line:** Run the application from the command line to see detailed error messages:
   ```bash
   python scout_ops_extractor.py
   ```

### UI Elements Not Responding

**Symptoms:** Buttons don't work, text fields don't accept input, or the interface appears frozen.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Restart the application:** Close and reopen Scout Ops Extractor.
2. **Check system resources:** The application might be competing for resources with other programs.
3. **Update PyQt5:** Your PyQt installation might be outdated or corrupted.
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade PyQt5
   ```

## Data Processing Issues

### CSV Export Errors

**Symptoms:** Error messages when trying to export CSV files or corrupted/empty CSV files.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Check file permissions:** Ensure you have write permissions to the output directory.
2. **Check if files are in use:** Another application (like Excel) might have the CSV files open.
3. **Use a different output directory:** Specify a different output path in the application settings.
4. **Verify data structure:** The API might have returned unexpected data structures that the converter cannot handle.

### Incorrect or Missing Data

**Symptoms:** Data seems incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent with what appears on The Blue Alliance website.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Refresh the data:** Force a refresh by using the "Update existing files" option.
2. **Check data sources:** Compare what's showing on The Blue Alliance website with your application results.
3. **Verify event key and match numbers:** Ensure you're looking at the correct event and match data.
4. **API version changes:** The Blue Alliance or Statbotics may have updated their API structure.

## Output File Issues

### Cannot Open Generated Files

**Symptoms:** CSV or JSON files cannot be opened or appear corrupted in other applications.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Check file encoding:** Some applications might not properly handle UTF-8 encoded files. Try opening in a different application.
2. **Inspect file contents:** Open the file in a text editor to see if it contains any data.
3. **Check file extensions:** Ensure the file has the correct extension (.csv or .json).
4. **Regenerate the files:** Try running the export process again.

### Issues with Long Team Names or Special Characters

**Symptoms:** CSV files display incorrectly in Excel or have formatting issues with certain team names.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Use "Data â†’ From Text" in Excel:** Import the CSV file using Excel's import wizard instead of double-clicking.
2. **Specify UTF-8 encoding:** When opening in Excel, specify UTF-8 encoding during the import process.
3. **Use alternative software:** Try using Google Sheets or LibreOffice Calc which may handle encoding better.

## Configuration Issues

### Settings Not Saving

**Symptoms:** API key or event key not remembered between sessions.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Check file permissions:** Ensure the application has permission to write to the configuration file.
2. **Check storage location:** The configuration file (`scouting_config.json`) should be in the same directory as the application.
3. **Manually edit the config file:** Open `scouting_config.json` in a text editor and verify the content.

```json
{
  "tba_api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  "tba_event_key": "2025miket",
  "tba_output_dir": "C:/path/to/output/tba_data",
  "stats_output_dir": "C:/path/to/output/match_stats"
}
```

### Errors with Non-ASCII Characters in Paths

**Symptoms:** Application crashes or fails to save files when using paths with non-English characters.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Use ASCII-only paths:** Avoid using special characters or non-English letters in output directories.
2. **Quote the path:** If using the command line, enclose paths in quotes.
3. **Use shorter paths:** Path length limitations might cause issues on some systems.

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

For advanced users, you can enable debug mode to get more detailed logs:

1. Create a file named `debug.flag` in the application directory
2. Run the application
3. Check the generated `debug.log` file for detailed error information

### Reporting Issues

If you cannot resolve an issue using this guide, please report it by:

1. Generating a diagnostic report:
   ```bash
   python scout_ops_extractor.py --diagnostic
   ```
2. Attaching the generated `diagnostic_report.txt` to your issue report
3. Describing the steps to reproduce the problem
4. Including any error messages displayed

Send this information to the Scout Ops development team or create an issue on the GitHub repository.
