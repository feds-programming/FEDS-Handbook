# Scout-Ops-Android Data Analysis Guide

This guide is designed for data analysts and scouting leads who need to process, analyze, and visualize the data collected through the Scout-Ops-Android application.

## Data Export Formats

Scout-Ops-Android exports data in multiple formats:

### QR Code Format

QR codes contain a compressed JSON string with the following structure:

```json
{
  "match_number": "Q42",
  "team_number": "201",
  "alliance_color": "red",
  "alliance_position": 1,
  "scouter_name": "John Doe",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-12T14:30:00Z",
  "autonomous": {
    "starting_position": { "x": 2.5, "y": 1.8 },
    "mobility": true,
    "scoring": {
      "amp": 1,
      "speaker": 2,
      "source_pickup": 3
    }
  },
  "teleop": {
    "scoring": {
      "amp": 4,
      "speaker": 6,
      "trap": 1,
      "source_pickup": 8
    },
    "defense_time_seconds": 15
  },
  "endgame": {
    "climb_attempted": true,
    "climb_successful": true,
    "climb_position": "deep",
    "harmony_achieved": false
  },
  "comments": "Fast cycle times, struggled with trap scoring"
}
```

### CSV Export Format

The CSV export contains all match data in a tabular format with the following columns:

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Step 1: Data Collection

Data is collected through:
- QR code scanning
- Bluetooth PAN transfers
- Manual CSV uploads

### Step 2: Data Cleaning

Before analysis, perform these data cleaning steps:

1. **Remove duplicates**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   
   # Load data
   df = pd.read_csv('scouting_data.csv')
   
   # Remove duplicates based on match and team
   df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['match_id', 'team_number'])
   ```

2. **Handle missing values**:
   ```python
   # Fill missing numeric values with 0
   numeric_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=['int', 'float']).columns
   df[numeric_columns] = df[numeric_columns].fillna(0)
   
   # Fill missing boolean values with False
   boolean_columns = ['auto_mobility', 'climb_attempted', 'climb_successful']
   for col in boolean_columns:
       df[col] = df[col].fillna(False)
   ```

3. **Validate data ranges**:
   ```python
   # Ensure counts are non-negative
   count_columns = [col for col in df.columns if 'count' in col]
   for col in count_columns:
       df.loc[df[col] < 0, col] = 0
   ```

### Step 3: Metric Calculation

Calculate key performance metrics:

1. **Total Scoring**:
   ```python
   df['total_amp_score'] = df['auto_amp_count'] + df['teleop_amp_count']
   df['total_speaker_score'] = df['auto_speaker_count'] + df['teleop_speaker_count']
   df['total_score'] = (
       df['total_amp_score'] * 2 +       # Amp = 2 points
       df['total_speaker_score'] * 5 +   # Speaker = 5 points
       df['teleop_trap_count'] * 5       # Trap = 5 points
   )
   ```

2. **Cycle Time Estimation**:
   ```python
   # Estimate cycle time in seconds
   total_game_pieces = (
       df['total_amp_score'] + 
       df['total_speaker_score'] + 
       df['teleop_trap_count']
   )
   
   # 135 seconds of scoring time (150 - 15 seconds for auton)
   df['estimated_cycle_time'] = 135 / total_game_pieces.replace(0, 1)
   ```

3. **Consistency Rating**:
   ```python
   # Group by team and calculate standard deviation of scores
   team_consistency = df.groupby('team_number')['total_score'].std().reset_index()
   team_consistency.columns = ['team_number', 'score_std_dev']
   
   # Lower std dev = more consistent
   team_consistency['consistency_rating'] = 10 - (team_consistency['score_std_dev'] / 10).clip(0, 10)
   ```

### Step 4: Team Performance Analysis

Aggregate metrics by team:

```python
team_performance = df.groupby('team_number').agg({
    'total_score': ['mean', 'median', 'std', 'min', 'max', 'count'],
    'auto_mobility': 'mean',  # % of matches with mobility
    'climb_successful': 'mean',  # % of successful climbs
    'climb_attempted': 'mean',  # % of climb attempts
    'defense_time_seconds': 'mean'  # Average defense time
}).reset_index()

# Rename columns for clarity
team_performance.columns = [
    'team_number', 'avg_score', 'median_score', 'score_std_dev', 
    'min_score', 'max_score', 'match_count', 'mobility_rate',
    'climb_success_rate', 'climb_attempt_rate', 'avg_defense_time'
]
```

## Data Visualization with Tableau

Scout-Ops-Android data can be imported directly into Tableau for visualization:

### Recommended Visualization Types

1. **Team Performance Dashboard**:
   - Bar charts showing average scores by team
   - Heat maps showing scoring consistency
   - Line charts showing performance trends over matches

2. **Alliance Selection Helper**:
   - Scatter plots of teams by scoring vs. climbing ability
   - Parallel coordinates plots for multi-dimensional comparison
   - Radar charts comparing performance across categories

3. **Match Prediction Tools**:
   - Stacked bar charts comparing predicted alliance performance
   - Histogram showing predicted score distributions
   - Heat maps showing alliance compatibility

### Tableau Setup Steps

1. Connect to the CSV data source
2. Create calculated fields for key metrics
3. Build interactive dashboards with filters for:
   - Match type (Qualification, Playoff)
   - Team number
   - Alliance color
   - Specific capabilities (climbing, defense, etc.)

## Integration with PyIntel Scoutz

For advanced analysis, the data can be integrated with PyIntel Scoutz:

```python
from pyintel_scoutz import ScoutzAnalyzer

# Load data
analyzer = ScoutzAnalyzer()
analyzer.load_csv('scout_ops_data.csv')

# Run predictive models
predictions = analyzer.predict_match_outcomes('Q42')
optimal_alliance = analyzer.suggest_optimal_alliance('201')

# Generate reports
analyzer.generate_team_report('201', output_path='team_201_report.pdf')
analyzer.generate_event_summary(output_path='event_summary.pdf')
```

## Competition Workflows

### Pre-Match Analysis

Before each match:

1. Filter data for teams in upcoming match
2. Compare performance metrics and strengths
3. Generate strategy recommendations for drive team

### Alliance Selection Support

During alliance selection:

1. Sort teams by key performance metrics
2. Highlight complementary teams for your strategy
3. Provide real-time compatibility analysis

### Post-Event Analysis

After the competition:

1. Compare actual vs. predicted performance
2. Identify data collection issues or biases
3. Generate insights for future competition preparation

## Common Data Analysis Pitfalls

1. **Observer Bias**: Different scouts may rate the same performance differently
   - Solution: Normalize data by scouter or use objective metrics only

2. **Small Sample Size**: Teams with few matches have less reliable metrics
   - Solution: Include confidence intervals in analyses

3. **Missing Context**: Raw numbers don't capture field conditions or robot failures
   - Solution: Include comments and match video reviews in analysis

## Custom Analysis Scripts

For advanced users, custom Python scripts can enhance data analysis:

```python
# Example: Defense impact analysis
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('scouting_data.csv')

# Calculate average score with and without defense
def defense_impact():
    # Define 'defended' as matches where defense time > 20 seconds
    df['defended'] = df['defense_time_seconds'] > 20
    
    # Group by team and whether they were defended
    impact = df.groupby(['team_number', 'defended'])['total_score'].mean().reset_index()
    
    # Pivot for comparison
    impact_pivot = impact.pivot(index='team_number', columns='defended', values='total_score')
    impact_pivot.columns = ['score_without_defense', 'score_with_defense']
    
    # Calculate defense impact percentage
    impact_pivot['defense_impact_pct'] = 100 * (1 - (impact_pivot['score_with_defense'] / impact_pivot['score_without_defense']))
    
    return impact_pivot

# Plot results
defense_data = defense_impact()
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.barplot(x=defense_data.index, y=defense_data['defense_impact_pct'])
plt.title('Impact of Defense on Team Scoring (%)')
plt.xlabel('Team Number')
plt.ylabel('Score Reduction (%)')
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('defense_impact.png')
```

By mastering these data analysis techniques, you can transform Scout-Ops-Android data into strategic insights that give your team a competitive edge.
