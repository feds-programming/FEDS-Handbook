## Introduction

Welcome to the code dive for the 2025 season, Reefscape! This year on our robot, Stingray, we took a bunch of steps from last year, which came with many programming challenges!

### Robot Breakdown
Here is a quick list on how our robot was structured this year:
- A continuous elevator to raise to score coral / algae
- A pivoting "Gooseneck" that holds coral in the bottom section and algae in the top section
- A funnel to recieve coral from coral stations
- A winch system climber for deep cage climbing
- CTRE-Based SDS Mk4i swerve drive
- 3 LL3's for Apriltag localization

With this quick breakdown in mind, lets *dive* into the code dive!
> Haha... That one was *pretty* funny I can't lie. Get it? Dive, because Reefscape.. and all that, you know? Well.. anyways..
