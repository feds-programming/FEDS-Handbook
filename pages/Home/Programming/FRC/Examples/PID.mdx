## What is PID?

PID stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative. It is a control loop feedback mechanism that is used to control systems. PID is used to control the speed of the robot, the position of the robot, and the angle of the robot. PID is used in many different applications such as robotics, automation, and control systems.

## How does PID work?

PID works by using three different components: Proportional, Integral, and Derivative. The Proportional component is used to control the current error of the system. The Integral component is used to control the past error of the system. The Derivative component is used to control the future error of the system. By using these three components, PID is able to control the system and keep it stable.

## How to implement PID in FRC?

To implement PID in FRC, you will need to create a PID controller. A PID controller is a class that is used to control the system using PID. The PID controller will take in the setpoint, the current value, and the output value. The PID controller will then calculate the error, the proportional value, the integral value, and the derivative value. The PID controller will then calculate the output value and send it to the system.

### PID Controller Class

```java
private PIDController pidController;

public void initPID() {
    pidController = new PIDController(0.1, 0.01, 0.001);
    pidController.setSetpoint(0);
    pidController.setTolerance(0.1);
    pidController.enableContinuousInput(-180, 180);
    pidController.enable();
}
```

### Using PID Controller

```java
public void usePID() {
    double output = pidController.calculate(currentValue);
    system.setOutput(output);
}
```

## Conclusion

PID is a powerful control loop feedback mechanism that is used to control systems. PID is used in many different applications such as robotics, automation, and control systems. By using PID, you can control the speed of the robot, the position of the robot, and the angle of the robot. PID is a powerful tool that can be used to control systems and keep them stable.
