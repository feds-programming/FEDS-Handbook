# FEDS 201 Electrical Subgroup - Operational Manual

## Executive Summary

The FEDS 201 Electrical Subgroup operates as the central nervous system architect for our competitive robotics platform. Our responsibilities span from initial electrical design through competition-day troubleshooting, ensuring robust, safe, and reliable robot operation under demanding field conditions.

This operational manual serves as the comprehensive reference for all electrical systems, procedures, and standards employed by our team, incorporating lessons learned from the 2025 REEFSCAPES season and establishing protocols for future competitive cycles.

<br />
<strong>Mission Statement</strong> 

<p>To design, implement, and maintain electrical systems that provide reliable power distribution, precise motor control, accurate sensor feedback, and robust communication networks that enable our robot to perform at peak efficiency while adhering to all FRC safety and competition standards.</p>

## Strategic Operational Framework

Our electrical operations are structured around four core domains, each requiring specialized knowledge and systematic approach to ensure seamless integration and optimal performance.
