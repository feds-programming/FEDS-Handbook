### Pre-Match Setup

Before starting to scout, ensure your app is properly configured:

1. Tap the navigation menu (☰) in the top-left corner
2. Go to Settings (⚙️)

### Match Scouting Process

The app follows a logical flow that matches the progression of an FRC match:

#### 1. Match Selection

- Enter match number
- Select alliance color (Red/Blue)
- Select team position (1-3)
- Select the team you are scouting

#### 2. Autonomous Phase

- Tap the field map to indicate robot's starting position
- Use counters to track autonomous scoring actions
- Record mobility and other autonomous-specific actions

#### 3. Teleop Phase

- Record scoring actions using the intuitive counter interface
- Track note scoring in different locations
- Record defensive actions or other strategic plays

#### 4. Endgame

- Record climbing attempts and successes
- Note final position (shallow/deep climb, parked, etc.)

#### 5. Data Transfer

After completing a match:
- Swipe to finalize your scouting data
- The app will generate a QR code containing all match data
- If using Bluetooth PAN, the data will automatically transfer to the connected device

## Adding Comments and Notes

During any phase, you can add comments about robot performance. These notes are valuable for alliance selection and match strategy discussions. Some examples of useful comments:

- "Robot had difficulty picking up notes from the source"
- "Very effective defense, blocked multiple scoring attempts"
- "Fast and accurate shooter, consistently scored in amp"
- "Climbing mechanism failed during match"

### Data Transfer Methods

Scout-Ops-Android supports multiple data transfer methods:

1. **QR Code** - Display a QR code containing match data for scanning
2. **Bluetooth PAN** - Transfer data wirelessly to a connected device
3. **Local Storage** - All data is stored locally until transferred

## Best Practices
