# Scout-Ops-Android Troubleshooting Guide

This guide addresses common issues encountered when using Scout-Ops-Android and provides step-by-step solutions.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### App Installation Problems

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "App not compatible with device" | Ensure your device runs Android 7.0 or newer. Check Amazon App Store for updates. |
| Installation freezes | Cancel installation, restart device, and try again. Check available storage space. |
| App crashes immediately after installation | Clear app cache and data, then restart device. Reinstall if necessary. |

### Permission-Related Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Permissions prompt not appearing | Go to device Settings > Apps > Scout-Ops-Android > Permissions and manually grant required permissions. |
| App features not working after denying permissions | Navigate to device Settings > Apps > Scout-Ops-Android > Permissions and enable all required permissions. |
| "Location permission required" error | Enable location services on your device and grant location permission to the app. |

### Event Data Loading Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Invalid event key" error | Double-check the event key format (e.g., "2025MITRY"). Verify on The Blue Alliance that the event exists. |
| Event data fails to download | Check internet connection. Retry with Wi-Fi if possible. The event might not be available yet in The Blue Alliance database. |
| Indicator remains red after download attempt | Verify internet connection and event key. Try clearing app cache and restarting. |

### Data Collection and Entry Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Counters not responding | Restart the app. If persistent, clear app cache and restart device. |
| Unable to progress to next phase | Complete all required fields in the current phase. Look for error messages indicating missing information. |
| App freezes during match data entry | Force close the app, restart, and resume from the last auto-saved point. |

### Data Transfer Problems

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| QR code not displaying | Ensure you've completed all required fields and swiped to finalize. If still not displaying, try force-stopping the app and restarting. |
| QR code too small/unreadable | Increase screen brightness to maximum. Ensure scanning device is positioned correctly (8-12 inches away). |
| Bluetooth PAN connection failing | Ensure both devices have Bluetooth enabled and are within range. Forget and re-pair the devices if necessary. |
| Data transfer timeout | Move devices closer together. Restart both devices' Bluetooth. Try alternative transfer method (QR code). |

### Data Management Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing match data | Check Logs section to verify if data was saved. Restore from backup if available. |
| Duplicate match entries | In Logs, identify duplicates and delete the incorrect entries using the trash icon. |
| Unable to export data | Ensure storage permission is granted. Verify available storage space. Try exporting to a different location. |
