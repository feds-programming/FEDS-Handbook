## Architecture Overview

Scout Ops Extractor uses a modular architecture with several key components:

1. **API Clients** - Connect to The Blue Alliance and Statbotics
2. **UI Interface** - User-friendly PyQt5 interface for data access
3. **Data Processors** - Combine and transform data for analysis
4. **Export Modules** - Generate CSV and JSON output files

The application uses a multi-threaded approach to prevent UI freezing during data retrieval operations, with clear separation between the data processing and presentation layers.

## Sample Output

After processing, Scout Ops Extractor generates several output files:

- Event data CSV files with team lists, match schedules, and rankings
- Match prediction CSV files with alliance comparisons
- Team insights CSV files with performance metrics
- Combined JSON files with comprehensive match data

These outputs integrate directly with spreadsheet applications and the PyIntel Scoutz analysis tool for further processing.
