## Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)

Using a virtual environment is recommended to isolate the application's dependencies:

<Steps>
### Create a virtual environment
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv scout_ops_env

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv scout_ops_env
```

### Activate the virtual environment
```bash
# Windows
scout_ops_env\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source scout_ops_env/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies within the virtual environment
```bash
pip install PyQt5 requests
```

### Deactivate when finished
```bash
deactivate
```
</Steps>

## Creating a Desktop Shortcut

### Windows

1. Right-click on your desktop and select "New > Shortcut"
2. Enter the following command:
   ```
   pythonw.exe "PATH_TO_EXTRACTOR\scout_ops_extractor.py"
   ```
   Replace `PATH_TO_EXTRACTOR` with the actual path to the application folder
3. Click "Next" and give the shortcut a name like "Scout Ops Extractor"
4. Right-click the new shortcut, select "Properties"
5. Click "Change Icon" and browse to an appropriate icon file
6. Click "OK" to save changes

### macOS

1. Create a new text file with the following content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   cd /path/to/Scout-Ops-Extractor
   python3 scout_ops_extractor.py
   ```
2. Save the file as `launch_scout_ops.command`
3. Make the file executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x launch_scout_ops.command
   ```
4. Move the file to Applications or create an alias on your desktop

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

### Missing Dependencies

If you encounter errors related to missing modules, install them using pip:

```bash
pip install [module_name]
```

Common dependencies that might need manual installation:
- PyQt5
- requests
- json
- csv
- datetime

### PyQt5 Installation Problems

If PyQt5 installation fails, try the following alternatives:

```bash
# Option 1: Install PyQt5 binary wheels
pip install PyQt5-sip
pip install PyQt5

# Option 2: Use conda (if you have Anaconda/Miniconda installed)
conda install pyqt
```

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors on Linux or macOS:

```bash
# Install dependencies with sudo
sudo pip3 install PyQt5 requests

# Or use the --user flag
pip3 install --user PyQt5 requests
```

## Next Steps

After installation is complete:

1. Obtain an API key from [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/account)
2. Launch the application
3. Enter your API key in the settings
4. Test the connection by fetching data for a recent event
