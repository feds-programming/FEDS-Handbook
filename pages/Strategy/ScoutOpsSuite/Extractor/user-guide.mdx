# Scout Ops Extractor User Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on using the Scout Ops Extractor application for retrieving, processing, and analyzing FRC competition data.

## Application Interface

![Scout Ops Extractor Interface](/images/extractor-interface.png)

The Scout Ops Extractor has a tabbed interface with the following main sections:

1. **Blue Alliance Data** - Collect and convert data from The Blue Alliance API
2. **Match Statistics** - Generate match predictions and team insights

## Getting Started

### Obtaining API Keys

Before using Scout Ops Extractor, you'll need to obtain an API key from The Blue Alliance:

1. Visit [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/account)
2. Create an account or log in to your existing account
3. Navigate to the "Account" section
4. Request an API key by providing a description of your usage
5. Copy the provided API key for use in Scout Ops Extractor

<Callout type="warning">
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. The Blue Alliance has rate limits that apply to each API key.
</Callout>

### Understanding Event Keys

Throughout Scout Ops Extractor, you'll need to use event keys to identify specific FRC events:

- Event keys follow the format: `[year][event_code]`
- Example: `2025miket` for the 2025 Kettering University District event

You can find event codes on The Blue Alliance website by looking at the URL for an event:
- For example, `https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2025miket` has the event key `2025miket`

## Using The Blue Alliance Data Tab

The Blue Alliance Data tab allows you to retrieve and convert data from The Blue Alliance API.

### Fetching Event Data

1. Enter your TBA API Key in the designated field
2. Enter the Event Key for the competition you're interested in
3. Specify an output directory or use the default
4. Select whether to update existing files or create a new folder
5. Click "Fetch and Convert TBA Data"

<Callout type="info">
  By default, data will be saved in a new timestamped folder. Enable "Update existing files" to overwrite previous data.
</Callout>

### Understanding Output Files

After fetching data, several CSV files will be generated:

- **event_info.csv** - Basic information about the event
- **teams.csv** - List of teams participating in the event
- **matches.csv** - Complete match schedule with detailed scoring information
- **rankings.csv** - Current team rankings at the event
- **alliances.csv** - Alliance selections for playoff matches

These files provide a comprehensive snapshot of the event and can be used for further analysis in spreadsheet applications.

## Using the Match Statistics Tab

The Match Statistics tab provides advanced features for match predictions and team insights.

### Generating Match Predictions

To generate predictions for a specific match:

1. Enter your TBA API Key
2. Enter the Event Key
3. Specify the Match Number
4. Select the Match Type (qm, qf, sf, f) from the dropdown
   - qm = Qualification Match
   - qf = Quarter Final
   - sf = Semi Final
   - f = Final
5. Choose an output directory
6. Click "Fetch Match Data"

The application will retrieve match data from both The Blue Alliance and Statbotics, combining them to create a detailed prediction.

<Tabs items={['Prediction Output', 'Data Format']}>
  <Tab>
    The match prediction combines:
    
    - Team compositions for each alliance
    - Historical performance metrics (OPR/EPA)
    - Expected scoring breakdowns
    - Win probability for each alliance
    
    This information is presented in both JSON and CSV formats for flexibility.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    The combined JSON output follows this structure:
    ```json
    {
      "match_key": "2025miket_qm42",
      "event_key": "2025miket",
      "comp_level": "qm",
      "set_number": 1,
      "match_number": 42,
      "alliances": {
        "red": { ... team data ... },
        "blue": { ... team data ... }
      },
      "predictions": {
        "red_score": 65.8,
        "blue_score": 72.3,
        "red_win_prob": 0.42,
        "blue_win_prob": 0.58
      },
      "teams": { ... detailed team data ... }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Generating Team Insights

To generate comprehensive statistics for all teams at an event:

1. Enter your TBA API Key
2. Enter the Event Key
3. Choose an output directory
4. Click "Generate Team Insights"

This process will:
- Fetch team data from The Blue Alliance
- Retrieve statistical metrics from Statbotics
- Combine and process the data
- Generate a CSV file with key performance indicators

<Callout type="info">
  Team insights generation may take some time for events with many teams, as the application makes individual API requests for each team's data.
</Callout>

### Understanding Team Insights Data

The generated "All_Team_Insights.csv" file contains valuable information about each team:

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| team | Team number |
| nickname | Team name |
| city | Team's city |
| state | Team's state/province |
| country | Team's country |
| opr | Offensive Power Rating from TBA |
| epa_current | Current EPA score from Statbotics |
| epa_recent | Recent EPA trend from Statbotics |
| epa_mean | Mean EPA over the season |
| epa_max | Maximum EPA achieved |
| wins | Win count |
| losses | Loss count |
| ties | Tie count |
| win_rate | Win percentage |

This data is sorted by EPA to help identify top-performing teams quickly.

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Data Files

After generating data, you can:

1. Import CSV files into spreadsheet applications like Excel or Google Sheets
2. Create pivot tables to analyze team performances
3. Import into data visualization tools like Tableau
4. Use custom scripts to further process the data

### Automated Workflows

For competition use, consider these workflows:

1. **Pre-Event Preparation:**
   - Run "Fetch and Convert TBA Data" to get the team list and historical data
   - Generate "Team Insights" to analyze expected performance

2. **During Qualification Matches:**
   - Run "Fetch Match Data" before important matches to get predictions
   - Update event data periodically to track ranking changes

3. **Alliance Selection:**
   - Update "Team Insights" to get the latest performance metrics
   - Use the data to inform alliance selection strategy

## Saving and Loading Settings

Scout Ops Extractor remembers your settings between sessions, including:

- API keys
- Event keys
- Output directories

This makes it easy to quickly generate updated reports throughout a competition without re-entering all the configuration details.

## Exporting Data For Other Scout Ops Tools

The data generated by Scout Ops Extractor is designed to integrate with other components of the Scout Ops Suite:

- Team and match data can be imported into PyIntel Scoutz for advanced analytics
- Alliance prediction data can be used by drive teams for match strategy
- Performance metrics can validate and supplement data collected through Scout-Ops-Android
