# Behind the Scenes: Match Prediction God Simulation

This page explains and demonstrates the advanced simulation engine that powers the match prediction system. The simulation models each team's match as a dynamic decision tree, where outcomes adapt to both team statistics and user-defined parameters.

## How the Simulation Works

1. **Team Profiles**: Each team is modeled with statistical data (mean, standard deviation, consistency, climbing %, etc.) for each match phase.
2. **Decision Trees**: For every phase (Autonomous, Teleop, Endgame, Defense), the simulation uses a decision tree. Each node represents a possible action or outcome, with probabilities based on team stats and simulation inputs.
3. **Dynamic Inputs**: Simulation parameters (e.g., aggression, defense, random seed) can be adjusted. The decision tree adapts in real time, changing the simulation path and outcomes.
4. **Adaptive Outcomes**: Each simulation run is unique. The tree branches based on both historical data and random factors, reflecting real-world unpredictability.

## Example Simulation Flow

```python
import numpy as np

class TeamProfile:
    def __init__(self, auton_mean, teleop_mean, endgame_mean, defense_prob, climb_prob, stddevs):
        self.auton_mean = auton_mean
        self.teleop_mean = teleop_mean
        self.endgame_mean = endgame_mean
        self.defense_prob = defense_prob
        self.climb_prob = climb_prob
        self.stddevs = stddevs

def simulate_phase(mean, stddev):
    return np.random.normal(mean, stddev)

def simulate_decision(prob):
    return np.random.rand() < prob

def simulate_team(team: TeamProfile, params):
    # Autonomous
    auton_score = simulate_phase(team.auton_mean, team.stddevs['auton'])
    # Teleop
    teleop_score = simulate_phase(team.teleop_mean, team.stddevs['teleop'])
    # Endgame: decision tree
    if simulate_decision(team.climb_prob):
        endgame_score = 15  # Deep climb
    elif simulate_decision(team.climb_prob * 0.5):
        endgame_score = 10  # Shallow climb
    else:
        endgame_score = 5 if simulate_decision(0.3) else 0  # Park or nothing
    # Defense
    defense_score = 5 if simulate_decision(team.defense_prob) else 0
    # Total
    return auton_score + teleop_score + endgame_score + defense_score

def simulate_match(red_teams, blue_teams, params):
    red_score = sum(simulate_team(team, params) for team in red_teams)
    blue_score = sum(simulate_team(team, params) for team in blue_teams)
    return red_score, blue_score
```

## Adaptive Decision Trees

- The simulation tree changes based on input parameters (e.g., toggling "aggressive defense" increases defense probability and may reduce scoring).
- Each run can be visualized or logged to show the decision path for every team.

## Machine Learning Integration

- Simulation results are fed into an XGBoost model for win probability, using features like total phase scores and defense value.
- The model adapts as more data is collected, improving prediction accuracy.

## Visualization

- Phase-by-phase breakdowns and decision paths can be visualized with stacked bar charts and color gradients, as described in the [Match Prediction Mathematics](../MatchPredictionMathematics.mdx) document.
