## Season 2021-2022

### Mk1:

#### Major System Elements

- Google Sheets  
- Paper scouting  
- WIFI  

**Pros:**

- Accessible to everyone for editing
- Collaborative data input

**Cons:**

- Very slow performance  
- Unreliable  
- Significant data loss  
- Data primarily available for creating pick lists and playoff use

**Improvements Needed:**

- Faster data input methods  
- Enhanced data visualization

#### Summary of Events

We built the scouting system from the ground up, starting with paper scouting at the Stoney Creek competition. Data was often inaccurate and overwhelming, leading to manual entry into Google Sheets. We were fortunate to use RCS WIFI at that competition, but eventually had to omit low-scoring robot data due to time constraints. The picklist process was sluggish because the data was neither quick to reference nor reliable.

The idea to automate this process emerged from the strenuous effort required to transfer information from paper to computer. Observing other teams using technology for scouting, we recognized the potential for a more efficient system.

### Mk2:

#### Major System Elements

- Excel (SPAMalytics)  
- Paper scouting  
- Offline capabilities  

**Pros:**

- Significantly faster than Mk1  
- Reliable with minimal data loss  
- Data remained synchronized with match timings

#### Summary of Events

At the Lansing competition, we encountered similar issues but discovered team 180 S.P.A.M’s more user-friendly Excel scouting system. Using the [SPAMalytics Excel sheet](https://www.spamrobotics.com/spamalytics/), data entry was much faster, keeping us nearly up-to-date with match data. Although data accuracy was still a concern, the main issue was the inability to receive data before qualification matches. SPAMalytics restricted us to pre-existing data fields, limiting our ability to gather diverse robot data. Despite this, we generated effective picklists by identifying underrated teams. However, we couldn’t assess defense abilities accurately and relied on intuition for selecting defense robots. **Scouting significantly contributed to our success at the Lansing competition.**

While SPAMalytics provided a foundational idea for our future scouting structure, we sought greater automation. The excessive use of paper over the past two competitions was unacceptable, with over 500 pages discarded post-competition.   
**No scouting was conducted at States as we couldn’t manage the data volume at that competition scale.**

## Season 2022-2023:


**Someone:** This is the breakdown of the initial data flow idea.  
**Zayn:** It seems the original documentation doesn’t reflect what actually transpired. Despite my reservations about Michael Kaatz, I respect his programming expertise. The complexity attributed to him is unfounded and inaccurate.  
Sukhesh and I, with input from Adit, Timothy, and Andrew Salmonson, designed the current system. Michael’s approach involved transferring QR code data using bitfields and bitmasks to compartmentalize data within limited bytes. While ingenious, I opted against it to include textual information alongside numerical data.  
**Zayn’s Note:** Although Michael’s method was clever, it didn’t meet our requirement for textual data storage.

### Mk3: Girl’s Comp ‘22

#### Major System Elements

- Android Studio App  
- Python QR Script  
- Tableau Data Visualization

#### Summary of Events

#### Summer Development

During the summer, we planned to develop a scouting app for Android. We chose CSV data stored in QR codes for data transfer, avoiding unreliable Bluetooth connections. The concept was inspired by the [Citrus Circuit whitepaper](https://www.citruscircuits.org/uploads/6/9/3/4/6934550/2022_whitepaper.pdf). CSV files were necessary for Tableau visualization. Each QR code would store CSV data, saved to a computer-readable CSV file for Tableau. We provided six Android tablets for data gathering, simplifying app development.

#### App Development (Zayn’s Analysis)

Sukhesh and I, with strong Java backgrounds, developed the Android app. Sukhesh handled UI elements, while I focused on functionality. We initially implemented a directory bar but switched to a hamburger menu. The main page listed all matches, each opening to a detailed match page with pre-filled information (Robot #, Qual Number, Qual Type). We considered a settings page but ultimately removed it.

For data persistence, I used Shared Preferences with a JSON list of matches. Although functional, Shared Preferences was slow, prompting us to seek a more robust data storage solution.

Sukhesh duplicated UI elements using a for-loop and Java’s reflection library to assign event triggers dynamically. While over-engineered, this approach enhanced my Java knowledge. Future improvements include adopting Clean Code practices.

The app integrated with [The Blue Alliance API](https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs) for match numbers. However, match data wasn’t available in time, necessitating manual entry.  
**Zayn’s Note:** Adit assisted with manual match input.

Post-development, we utilized QR scanners to transfer data, inspired by the Citrus Circuit whitepaper.  
**\<ZAYN FINISH WRITING UP CODING THE QR SCANNER\>**

#### Girl’s Comp Testing

The scouting system was tested at Girl’s Comp without major issues using a developing Tableau workbook. Data wasn’t used for strategy but validated the system. One issue was the pick list's readability, requiring Luis to assist Anna.

Girl’s Comp confirmed our system’s potential but highlighted the need for a sustainable, minimally program-dependent scouting app.  
**Note:** Team numbers and matches were entered manually since Blue Alliance data wasn’t available.

### Mk4: Wayne State

Wayne State presented challenges. Through Zayn’s dedication, we completed the app with minor QR scanner tweaks. A significant issue was the limited number of team members proficient in Tableau. Adit, the drive coach/scouting lead, had to frequently retrieve and relay data manually, inspiring the idea to connect scouting information directly to the pit monitor for easier access.

### Mk5: Troy

Troy was similarly challenging. Mid-competition, the QR scanner code failed, halting scouting efforts.  
**Lesson Learned:** Always back up data on hard drives to prevent loss. Additionally, ensure all critical code is stored on GitHub.

### MK5.5-ish: FIM States

Our app, now more reliable, proved highly useful for scouting at States, aiding in strategy development. We identified the need for improved playoff scouting, focusing on offensive and defensive strategies per alliance. We also developed the ability to calculate team scores, enhancing data utility.

### Worlds Scouting with Team 

Timothy needs to add details regarding scouting at Worlds.  
**Post-Worlds Discussion:** We realized the necessity for a different app for each year’s challenge. Existing apps weren’t suitable due to varying visualization software. We plan to develop a new app similar to [FRC Scouter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercilex.robotscouter&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1), featuring a customizable template system for data fields. This ensures adaptability while maintaining our preferred QR-CSV-Tableau workflow.

### Major Strategies in the 2022-2023 Season

We developed several effective strategies this season:

- **Penalty Zones:** Strategically pushing opponents into penalty zones to trigger penalties.
- **Consistent Charge Station Performance:** Reliable drive over the charge station allowed the creation of additional driving lanes.

## Season 2023-2024:

### Bloomfield Off-Season Competition

**Pros:**  
- Reliable app performance (although a new app is in development)  
- Smooth data transfer  
- Fast data integration with Tableau

**Cons:**  
- Data readiness issues
