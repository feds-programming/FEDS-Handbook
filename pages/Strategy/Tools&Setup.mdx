# Scouting and Strategy Tools and Setup

## Season 2024-25

### Scouting App

This year, we developed a Scouting System from the ground up, consisting of a Web App, a Mobile App, and a Backend Server. The Web App is used by the Scouting Team to input data and monitor all the scouts' progress in real-time. It can also export the data into an Excel spreadsheet. The Mobile App is used by the Scouting Team to input data, and the Backend Server is used to store the data, provide it to the Strategy Team, and simulate real matches.

  The Simulation depends on Wifi and the Backend Server. Make sure to have a stable connection.
