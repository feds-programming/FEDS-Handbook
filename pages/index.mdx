## Our Team's Mission

The FEDS' mission is to inspire students to become STEM leaders through mentoring and innovation.

## Subgroups

To support your learning journey, we have a variety of subgroups that focus on different aspects of robotics. These include:

<Cards>
    <Card title="Programming" href="/Programming" icon={FaCode()}>
        The programming subgroup focuses on developing the software that controls the robot. Members learn programming languages like Java and C++ and work on autonomous routines and driver controls.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Electrical" href="/Electrical/Tools&Setup" icon={FaPlug()}>
        The electrical subgroup is responsible for designing and wiring the electrical systems on the robot. Members learn about circuits, sensors, and power distribution.
    </Card>
    <Card title="CAD" href="/CAD/Introduction" icon={FaCube()} >
        The CAD subgroup uses computer-aided design software to create 3D models of the robot. Members learn about mechanical design and create detailed drawings for manufacturing.

## Tools and Resources

FRC teams and the resources they use aren't always the most environmentally friendly. This and being inspired by the rule in the manual G201, we wanted to understand as a team what our impact on our environment is and identify what steps we can take to reduce it.

Our mission: Promote a team culture that cultivates good persons and increases sustainable practices at a team level.

As a team we thought of many different projects that could further our goal. Ideas ranged from finding new uses for old FRC parts to eliminating single use items. Ideas have been prioritized so that we can achieve these goals over time.

    <Card title="G201 Calculator" href="/G201Calculator" icon={FaExpeditedssl()}>
        The G201 Calculator is a tool that helps teams calculate their environmental impact and identify areas for improvement. It provides a score based on the team's practices and offers suggestions for reducing their impact.
