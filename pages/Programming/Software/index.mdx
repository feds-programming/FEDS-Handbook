# Welcome to FRC Wing
<strong> Where Code Meets Competition</strong>

FRC programming isn’t just about writing code. It’s about breathing life into machines, making decisions faster than your Wi-Fi, and building a robot that doesn’t just move—but flexes on the competition. At FEDS 201, our programmers are the unsung heroes, turning caffeine into code, bugs into features, and chaos into (mostly) functional robots.

## 🔥 What You'll Learn in the FRC Wing
<p>
  Welcome, brave coder. If you're reading this, congratulations — you're officially in too deep. But hey, here's the good news: by the end of this, you'll be the reason the robot actually moves (and maybe even in the right direction).
