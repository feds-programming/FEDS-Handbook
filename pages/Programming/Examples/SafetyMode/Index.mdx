# Robot Safety Framework

## Introduction

This document is a work in progress. It is intended to provide a framework for the safety of robots. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to robot safety, but rather a starting point for the development of a safety program for robots.

## Definitions

- **A monitoring System**: A system that monitors the robot and its environment to detect unsafe conditions.
- **A control System**: A system that controls the robot to prevent unsafe conditions.
- **A safety System**: A system that ensures the safety of the robot and its environment.

## Safety Framework

The safety framework consists of three main components: a monitoring system, a control system, and a safety system.

### Monitoring System

The monitoring system is responsible for monitoring the robot and its environment to detect unsafe conditions. The monitoring system should be able to detect a wide range of unsafe conditions, including:

- **Collision Detection**: The monitoring system should be able to detect collisions between the robot and other objects in its environment.
- **Obstacle Detection**: The monitoring system should be able to detect obstacles in the robot's path and take appropriate action to avoid them.
- **Emergency Stop**: The monitoring system should be able to detect when an emergency stop is required and take appropriate action to stop the robot.

### Control System

The control system is responsible for controlling the robot to prevent unsafe conditions. The control system should be able to prevent a wide range of unsafe conditions, including:

- **Collision Prevention**: The control system should be able to prevent collisions between the robot and other objects in its environment.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The control system should be able to avoid obstacles in the robot's path and take appropriate action to avoid them.
- **Emergency Stop**: The control system should be able to stop the robot in an emergency situation.

### Safety System

The safety system is responsible for ensuring the safety of the robot and its environment. The safety system should be able to ensure the safety of the robot in a wide range of situations, including:

- **Safe Operation**: The safety system should ensure that the robot is operated safely in all situations.
- **Safe Environment**: The safety system should ensure that the robot's environment is safe for operation.
- **Safe Design**: The safety system should ensure that the robot is designed to be safe for operation.
