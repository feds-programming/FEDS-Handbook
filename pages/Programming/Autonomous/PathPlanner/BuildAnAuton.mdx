# Building An Auton

## Download PathPlanner LIB

PathPlannerLib can be added to your robot code project using the "Install New Libraries (online)" feature in VSCode using the following JSON file URL:

```java
https://3015rangerrobotics.github.io/pathplannerlib/PathplannerLib.json
```

## Configure AutoBuilder
In PathPlannerLib, AutoBuilder is used to create full autonomous routines based on auto files created in the GUI app. In order for AutoBuilder to be able to build these auto routines, it must first be configured to control your robot.

There are a few options for configuring AutoBuilder, one for each type of path following command: Holonomic, Ramsete, and LTV.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Since all of the AutoBuilder configuration is related to the drive subsystem, it is recommended to configure AutoBuilder within your drive subsystem's constructor.
</Callout>

The following examples will assume that your drive subsystem has the following methods:

* getPose - Returns the current robot pose as a Pose2d

* resetPose - Resets the robot's odometry to the given pose

* getRobotRelativeSpeeds or getCurrentSpeeds - Returns the current robot-relative ChassisSpeeds. This can be calculated using one of WPILib's drive kinematics classes

driveRobotRelative or drive - Outputs commands to the robot's drive motors given robot-relative ChassisSpeeds. This can be converted to module states or wheel speeds using WPILib's drive kinematics classes.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    The AutoBuilder configuration requires a method that will return true when a path should be flipped to the red side of the field. The origin of the field coordinate system will remain on the blue side.

    If you wish to have any other alliance color based transformation, you must implement it yourself by changing the data passed to, and received from, PathPlannerLib's path following commands.
</Callout>

### Holonomic (Swerve)
```java
    public class DriveSubsystem extends SubsystemBase {
      public DriveSubsystem() {
        // All other subsystem initialization
        // ...

        // Configure AutoBuilder last
        AutoBuilder.configureHolonomic(
                this::getPose, // Robot pose supplier
                this::resetPose, // Method to reset odometry (will be called if your auto has a starting pose)
                this::getRobotRelativeSpeeds, // ChassisSpeeds supplier. MUST BE ROBOT RELATIVE
                this::driveRobotRelative, // Method that will drive the robot given ROBOT RELATIVE ChassisSpeeds
                new HolonomicPathFollowerConfig( // HolonomicPathFollowerConfig, this should likely live in your Constants class
                        new PIDConstants(5.0, 0.0, 0.0), // Translation PID constants
                        new PIDConstants(5.0, 0.0, 0.0), // Rotation PID constants
                        4.5, // Max module speed, in m/s
                        0.4, // Drive base radius in meters. Distance from robot center to furthest module.
                        new ReplanningConfig() // Default path replanning config. See the API for the options here
                ),
                () -> {
                  // Boolean supplier that controls when the path will be mirrored for the red alliance
                  // This will flip the path being followed to the red side of the field.
                  // THE ORIGIN WILL REMAIN ON THE BLUE SIDE

                 var alliance = DriverStation.getAlliance();
                  if (alliance.isPresent()) {
                    return alliance.get() == DriverStation.Alliance.Red;
                }
                  return false;
                },
                this // Reference to this subsystem to set requirements
        );
      }
    }
```

### Ramsete (Differential)

```java
public class DriveSubsystem extends SubsystemBase {
  public DriveSubsystem() {
    // All other subsystem initialization
    // ...

    // Configure AutoBuilder last
    AutoBuilder.configureRamsete(
            this::getPose, // Robot pose supplier
            this::resetPose, // Method to reset odometry (will be called if your auto has a starting pose)
            this::getCurrentSpeeds, // Current ChassisSpeeds supplier
            this::drive, // Method that will drive the robot given ChassisSpeeds
            new ReplanningConfig(), // Default path replanning config. See the API for the options here
            () -> {
              // Boolean supplier that controls when the path will be mirrored for the red alliance
              // This will flip the path being followed to the red side of the field.
              // THE ORIGIN WILL REMAIN ON THE BLUE SIDE

              var alliance = DriverStation.getAlliance();
              if (alliance.isPresent()) {
                return alliance.get() == DriverStation.Alliance.Red;
              }
              return false;
            },
            this // Reference to this subsystem to set requirements
    );
  }
}
```

### LTV (Differential)

```java
public class DriveSubsystem extends SubsystemBase {
  public DriveSubsystem() {
    // All other subsystem initialization
    // ...

    // Configure AutoBuilder last
    AutoBuilder.configureLTV(
            this::getPose, // Robot pose supplier
            this::resetPose, // Method to reset odometry (will be called if your auto has a starting pose)
            this::getCurrentSpeeds, // Current ChassisSpeeds supplier
            this::drive, // Method that will drive the robot given ChassisSpeeds
            0.02, // Robot control loop period in seconds. Default is 0.02
            new ReplanningConfig(), // Default path replanning config. See the API for the options here
            () -> {
              // Boolean supplier that controls when the path will be mirrored for the red alliance
              // This will flip the path being followed to the red side of the field.
              // THE ORIGIN WILL REMAIN ON THE BLUE SIDE

              var alliance = DriverStation.getAlliance();
              if (alliance.isPresent()) {
                return alliance.get() == DriverStation.Alliance.Red;
              }
              return false;
            },
            this // Reference to this subsystem to set requirements
    );
  }
}
```

### Load an Auto

After you have configured the AutoBuilder, creating an auto is as simple as constructing a PathPlannerAuto with the name of the auto you made in the GUI.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
   It is highly recommended to create all of your autos when code starts, instead of creating them when you want to run them. Large delays can happen when loading complex autos/paths, so it is best to load them before they are needed.

    In the interest of simplicity, this example will show an auto being loaded in the getAutonomousCommand function, which is called when auto is enabled. This is not the recommended way to load your autos.
</Callout>

```java
public class RobotContainer {
  // ...

  public Command getAutonomousCommand() {
    return new PathPlannerAuto("Example Auto");
  }
}
```

### Create a SendableChooser with all autos in project

After configuring the AutoBuilder, you have the option to build a SendableChooser that is automatically populated with every auto in the project.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    This method will load all autos in the deploy directory. Since the deploy process does not automatically clear the deploy directory, old auto files that have since been deleted from the project could remain on the RIO, therefore being added to the auto chooser.

    To remove old options, the deploy directory will need to be cleared manually via SSH, WinSCP, reimaging the RIO, etc.
</Callout>

```java
public class RobotContainer {
  private final SendableChooser<Command> autoChooser;

  public RobotContainer() {
    // ...

    // Build an auto chooser. This will use Commands.none() as the default option.
    autoChooser = AutoBuilder.buildAutoChooser();

    // Another option that allows you to specify the default auto by its name
    // autoChooser = AutoBuilder.buildAutoChooser("My Default Auto");

    SmartDashboard.putData("Auto Chooser", autoChooser);
  }

  public Command getAutonomousCommand() {
    return autoChooser.getSelected();
  }
}
```

### Create a SendableChooser with certain autos in project

Note

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
This feature is only available in the Java version of PathPlannerLib
</Callout>

You can use the buildAutoChooserWithOptionsModifier method to process the autos before they are shown on shuffle board

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Be careful using runtime values when generating AutoChooser, as RobotContainer is built at robot code startup. Things like FMS values may not be present at startup
</Callout>


```java
public class RobotContainer {
  private final SendableChooser<Command> autoChooser;

  public RobotContainer() {
    // ...

    // For convenience a programmer could change this when going to competition.
    boolean isCompetition = true;

    // Build an auto chooser. This will use Commands.none() as the default option.
    // As an example, this will only show autos that start with "comp" while at
    // competition as defined by the programmer
    autoChooser = AutoBuilder.buildAutoChooserWithOptionsModifier(
      (stream) -> isCompetition
        ? stream.filter(auto -> auto.getName().startsWith("comp"))
        : stream
    );

    SmartDashboard.putData("Auto Chooser", autoChooser);
  }

  public Command getAutonomousCommand() {
    return autoChooser.getSelected();
  }
}
```
