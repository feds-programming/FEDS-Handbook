# Arm

### What can an arm do?

An arm subsystem can accomplish many unique tasks, some of which include Climbing, Placing game pieces, and raising other subsystems.
Arms commonly use Motors and encoders to rotate and keep track of rotation when in use.

### Example Arm Code

```java
public class Arm extends SubsystemBase {

  private final TalonFX armRotation; 
  private final DutyCycleEncoder armRotationEncoder;

  private final PIDController pid = ArmConstants.ArmPIDForExternalEncoder.GetArmPID();

   public Arm() {
    super();
    
    armRotation = new TalonFX(CANConstants.Arm.kArm);
    armRotation.getConfigurator().apply(ArmConstants.GetArmMotorConfiguration());
    armRotationEncoder = new DutyCycleEncoder(DIOConstants.Arm.kArmRotateEncoder);
   }
```


* This code creates an <u>Arm Motor</u>, <u>Arm Encoder</u>, and <u>PID Controller</u>.

* The TalonFX motor and DutyCycleEncoder both use ID's to differentiate themselves from other encoders / motors on a robot. In this case, the IDs are stored in seperate constants files.

### Setting Arm Limits 
Arms usually have a limited range of motion when they are a part of a robot. However, the motor does not know this by default, and moving the arm further than its range would definitely break the robot or the arm. This can be combatted by setting an <u>Arm rotation limit</u>.
### Example code 
```java
 public void rotateOrHold(double power) {
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("power to the arm", power);
    if(Math.abs(power) < ArmConstants.kHoldThreshold) { // if there is no power to the controller, hold
      hold();
    } else if(getArmAngle() < 5 && power < 0) { // if you are falling and the angle is less than 5, then dont move
      setOutput(0);
      setArmHoldActive(false);
    } else if (getArmAngle() > 90 && power > 0) { // if you are rising and the angle is greater than 90, then hold 90
      hold(90);
    } else { // else move using the output from the controller
      setOutput(power);
      setArmHoldActive(false);
    }
  }
```
* The `Hold` function sets the PID setpoint to the given angle.
```java
 public void hold(double angle) {
    if(!getArmHoldActive()) {
      setArmHoldAngle(angle);
      setArmHoldActive(true);
      setPIDTarget(getArmHoldAngle());
    }
```

* The passed in ```Double Angle``` is set as the Arm hold angle and is then set as the PID target for the arm.

## Arm Commands 

To create a command for the arm, we implement the arm subsystem into the command to use the already created motor, encoder, PID controller, and functions.

### Example code:

``` java
public class RotateArmToPosition extends Command {
    /** Creates a new RotateArm. */
    private final Arm c_arm;
    private final DoubleSupplier c_angle;
    private final boolean c_failure;

    public RotateArmToPosition(Arm arm, DoubleSupplier desiredAngle) {
        c_arm = arm;
        c_angle = desiredAngle;
        addRequirements(c_arm);

        if(desiredAngle.getAsDouble() < -20) {
            c_failure = true;
        } else {
            c_failure = false;
        }

        SmartDashboard.putBoolean("ARM FAILURE", c_failure);
        // Use addRequirements() here to declare subsystem dependencies.
    }

  ```
  * This code creates a command class for ```RotateArmToPosition``` and uses the ```arm``` subsystem.
  * It also uses a failsafe technique to prevent the arm from breaking. The code uses -20 as the threshold for ```desiredAngle``` before ```c_failure``` returns true. As long as the ```desiredAngle``` stays below -20, the command continues as normal.
  * The ```addRequirements(c_arm)``` function requires the arm subsystem to end all other commands using it. This can help prevent breaking of the robot because it does not allow two commands to try to use the same subsystem.
  <Callout emoji={"ðŸ‘€"} type={"info"}> Note that ```c_angle``` is set to be equal to ```desiredAngle```. </Callout>

  ### Initialize, Excecute, and End

When a new Command class is created, you will see ```initialize```, ```excecute```, ```end```, and ```isFinished``` functions. The ```excecute``` funtion is where what the command will do happens. ```initialize``` is for things that need to happen before the command, and ```end``` is for things that need to happen before the command finishes. The ```isFinished``` function determines when the command ends. It can determine this in itself by returning true, or when the command is interrupted.
### Example Code
``` java 
 @Override
  public void initialize() {
  }

  @Override
  public void execute() {
  }

  @Override
  public void end(boolean interrupted) {
  }

  @Override
  public boolean isFinished() {
    return false;
  }
```
* The ```initialize```, ```excecute```, ```end```, and ```isFinished``` functions are shown here.

### initialize, excecute, and end for ```RotateArmToPosition```

``` java
   // Called when the command is initially scheduled.
    @Override
    public void initialize() {
        c_arm.setPIDTarget(c_angle.getAsDouble());
    }

    // Called every time the scheduler runs while the command is scheduled.
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        if(!c_failure) {
            c_arm.rotateArmToTarget();
        } else {
            c_arm.setFailure(true);
        }
        
    }

    // Called once the command ends or is interrupted.
    @Override
    public void end(boolean interrupted) {
        c_arm.rotateOrHold(0);
    }

    // Returns true when the command should end.
    @Override
    public boolean isFinished() {
        return c_failure || c_arm.isArmAtTarget();
    }
```
<Callout type={"warning"} emoji={"ðŸ””"}> In This example, ```RotateArmToPosition``` Command uses all of the functions to complete its' purpose, but not all commands will have to. </Callout>
* In ```initialize```, the arm's PID target is set to ```c_angle```.
* The ```excecute``` function checks if faliure mode is true. If it is false, the ```rotateArmToTarget``` function is run which uses the arm PID to move it to the previously stated setpoint. If true, ```c_arm.setFailure``` is set to true.
* The ```end``` function sets the power of ```rotateOrHold``` to 0, keeping the arm at its setpoint. This is the same function that was detailed further up on this page. 
* Finally, the ```isFinished``` function ends the command either when faliure mode is true or when the arm reaches its' target.

#### Mapping commands to an Xbox controller

Now that our example command to move the arm is finished, we can move to ```RobotContainer``` to use the command on a robot. ```RobotContainer``` is where button bindings will be created, as well as adding autonomous paths. If all we wanted to do is move our arm, we could do it like this:
```java 
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.CommandXboxController;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.Trigger;
import frc.robot.commands.arm.RotateArmToPosition;
import frc.robot.subsystems.arm.Arm;

public class RobotContainer {

  private final Arm arm;
   public final CommandXboxController operatorController;
}

public RobotContainer {
     arm = new Arm();
   operatorController = new CommandXboxController(2);

}

public void configureOperatorController{
  operatorController.x(){
    .onTrue(
      new RotateArmToPosition(arm, () -> 30)
    )
    
  }
  

}
```

* First, we imported the ```arm``` subsystem, ```RotateArmToPosition``` command, and Xbox controller libraries so they could be used in ```RobotContainer```.
* Configuring the command to X on the ```operatorController``` was very simple, all that had to be done was pass in the ```arm``` subsystem and desired angle. In this case, the desired angle was 30.
* The () -> symbol is called a lambda function. it is used to create functions without a specific name. () defines the parameters the function takes. Because they are empty, the function doesn't take arguments. the -> is used to seperate perameters from the function body. 
* Similar to a motor that needs an ID, an Xbox controller needs a port number. In this case, we set the port number to two. The port of the Xbox controller can be manipulated in the DriverStation.
<Callout type={"info"} emoji={"ðŸ’¡"}>Usually, a robot will be controlled by two controllers, an operator controller and a driver controller. The driver controller will usually be used for driving and functions that should be done while on the move. The operator controller is for operating all of the other subsystems. Make sure to work with the <u>Drive team</u> when binding buttons. The most important thing is that they are comfortable with the button bindings!</Callout>

### Conclusion

Now, our example arm code is all done. We created an <u>arm subsystem</u> to create a motor, encoder, PID controller, and functions for the arm. We made a <u>RotateArmToPosition</u> using the arm subsystem to move the arm to an angle. Then we bound the command to a button in <u>RobotContainer</u> and set the arm setpoint to 30 degrees. this is just one example of what can be done with an arm. Many more things are possible, so always make sure to explore your options when programming anything. Happy coding!

* The passed in `Angle` is set as the Arm hold angle and is then set as the PID target for the arm.
