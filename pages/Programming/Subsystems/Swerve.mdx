# Drive Base

Our team predominantly uses CTR's Serve Drive System for our drive base. This system is a robust and reliable system that has been used by many teams in the past.

## Components

The drive base consists of the following components:

- **Motors**: We use Falcon 500 motors for our drive base.
- **Wheels**: We use 6-inch pneumatic wheels for our drive base.
- **Gearbox**: We use a custom gearbox for our drive base.
- **Encoders**: We use CTRE Mag Encoders for our drive base.
