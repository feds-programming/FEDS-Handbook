# Shooter

### What Does a Shooter Do?

A shooter is a great solution when game pieces have to be scored into a high goal. A shooter can typically be made with just one or two motors to spin a set of top and bottom / left and right wheels.

### Code Example

```java 
 private final TalonFX shooterTopMain; // Falcon
  private final TalonFX shooterBottomFollower; // Falcon

  private final MotionMagicVelocityVoltage motionMagic = new MotionMagicVelocityVoltage(0);

    public ShooterWheels() {
  
    shooterTopMain = new TalonFX(CANConstants.Shooter.kShooterTop);
    shooterBottomFollower = new TalonFX(CANConstants.Shooter.kShooterBottom);
    shooterTopMain.getConfigurator().apply(ShooterConstants.GetWheelsConfiguration());
    shooterBottomFollower.getConfigurator().apply(ShooterConstants.GetWheelsConfiguration());
    }

    public void setShootVelocityMotionMagic(double velocityTop, double velocityBottom) {
    motionMagic.Slot = 0;
    shooterTopMain.setControl(motionMagic.withVelocity(velocityTop));
    shooterBottomFollower.setControl(motionMagic.withVelocity(velocityBottom));
  }
```

* As seen previously in the Arm subsystem, TalonFX motors are instantiated, the motor that spins the top shooter wheels 
and the motor that spins the bottom shooter wheels.  
* The lines below that applies a talonFX motor configuration. The method being called can be seen below:
```java
 public static TalonFXConfiguration GetWheelsConfiguration() {
        TalonFXConfiguration configs = new TalonFXConfiguration();

         configs.Slot0.kP = 0.11; // An error of 1 rotation per second results in 0.11V output
         configs.Slot0.kI = 0.5;  // An accumulated error of 1 rotation per second increases output by 0.5V every second
         configs.Slot0.kD = 0.0001; // A change of 1 rotation per second squared results in 0.0001 volts output
        /*
         * Voltage-based velocity requires a feed forward to account for the back-emf of
         * the motor
         */
        configs.Slot0.kV = 0.12; // Falcon 500 is a 500kV motor, 500rpm per V = 8.333 rps per V, 1/8.33 = 0.12
                                 // volts / Rotation per second

        configs.MotionMagic.MotionMagicCruiseVelocity = 80;
        configs.MotionMagic.MotionMagicAcceleration = 160;
        configs.MotionMagic.MotionMagicJerk = 1600;

        // Peak output of 8 volts
        configs.Voltage.PeakForwardVoltage = 0.9 * 12;
        configs.Voltage.PeakReverseVoltage = -0.9 * 12;

        configs.TorqueCurrent.PeakForwardTorqueCurrent = 40;
        configs.TorqueCurrent.PeakReverseTorqueCurrent = -40;

        configs.MotorOutput.NeutralMode = NeutralModeValue.Coast;

        return configs;
    }
    ```

    * While this looks like a lot, it becomes much more straightforward after each part is explained.

    ### TalonFXConfiguration
    * Think of this like a "container" for the settings of the motor controller. Inside, there are a few main categories of configuration. 
    **Slot0 Configs**, **Motion Magic Settings**, **Voltage Limits**, **Current Limits**, and **Neutral Mode**.

### Code Explanation


### Slot 0 (PIDF Configuration)
```java
    configs.Slot0.kP = 0.11; // An error of 1 rotation per second results in 0.11V output
    configs.Slot0.kI = 0.5;  // An accumulated error of 1 rotation per second increases output by 0.5V every second
    configs.Slot0.kD = 0.0001; // A change of 1 rotation per second squared results in 0.0001 volts output
```

### What are Slot 0 configs?

* Slot 0 configs holds the PID and control loop parameters for motor configuration. 
While slot 0 is the default slot for these configurations, they can also be placed in slot 1, 2, and so on.

- **`Slot0.kP = 0.11;`**  
  This sets the **Proportional** gain (kP) for the PID controller in **Slot 0**. The proportional term determines how much 
  the controller output changes in response to the error. In this case, an error of 1 rotation per second would produce a 
  0.11V output change.

- **`Slot0.kI = 0.5;`**  
  This sets the **Integral** gain (kI), which accumulates over time. The integral term helps eliminate steady-state 
  error by adding a portion of the accumulated error to the output. With kI = 0.5, an error of 1 rotation per second 
  will increase the output by 0.5V every second, as the error persists.

- **`Slot0.kD = 0.0001;`**  
  This sets the **Derivative** gain (kD), which predicts the future error based on its rate of change. 
  The derivative term helps prevent overshooting and smoothens the response. A change of 1 rotation per 
  second squared will produce a 0.0001V output change.

### Voltage-Based Velocity Control (Feedforward)
```java
        /*
         * Voltage-based velocity requires a feed forward to account for the back-emf of
         * the motor
         */
    configs.Slot0.kV = 0.12; // Falcon 500 is a 500kV motor, 500rpm per V = 8.333 rps per V, 1/8.33 = 0.12
                             // volts / Rotation per second
```
- **`Slot0.kV = 0.12;`**  
  This sets the **voltage feedforward** term (kV), which compensates for the back electromotive force (back-EMF) of the motor. 
  Since the **Falcon 500** motor is rated at **500 kV**, this means the motor will spin at **500 RPM per volt** applied. 
  In this case, **0.12V** per **rotation per second** is used to account for the motor's characteristics. The formula comes 
  from converting motor RPM to **rotations per second (RPS)** and calculating the corresponding feedforward voltage.

### Motion Magic Settings
```java
    configs.MotionMagic.MotionMagicCruiseVelocity = 80;
    configs.MotionMagic.MotionMagicAcceleration = 160;
    configs.MotionMagic.MotionMagicJerk = 1600;
```
- **Motion Magic** is a control mode designed for smooth movement along a motion profile 
(e.g., for moving to a position smoothly).
- **`MotionMagicCruiseVelocity = 80;`**  
  This sets the **cruise velocity** for the motion profile, which is the speed the motor will aim to maintain once 
  it reaches a steady state in its motion. In this case, it's set to **80 units**.
  
- **`MotionMagicAcceleration = 160;`**  
  This sets the **acceleration** that the motor should use to reach the target velocity. Here, it's set to **160**.

- **`MotionMagicJerk = 1600;`**  
  This sets the **jerk**, which is the rate of change of acceleration. 
  Jerk limits how quickly the acceleration can change, preventing sudden, jerky movements. It's set to **1600**.

### Voltage Limits
```java
    configs.Voltage.PeakForwardVoltage = 0.9 * 12;
    configs.Voltage.PeakReverseVoltage = -0.9 * 12;
```
- **`PeakForwardVoltage = 0.9 * 12;`**  
 * This limits the **maximum forward voltage** output to **90% of 12V**, or **10.8V**. 

- **`PeakReverseVoltage = -0.9 * 12;`**  
 * **Maximum reverse voltage** is set to the opposite.

### Current Limits (Torque)
```java
    configs.TorqueCurrent.PeakForwardTorqueCurrent = 40;
    configs.TorqueCurrent.PeakReverseTorqueCurrent = -40;
```
- **`PeakForwardTorqueCurrent = 40;`**  
 * This sets the **maximum forward current** allowed to be sent to the motor for torque production. 
 * It limits the current to **40A** in the forward direction.

- **`PeakReverseTorqueCurrent = -40;`**  
  * **maximum reverse current** is set to the opposite.

### Neutral Mode (Motor Brake/Coast Mode)
```java
    configs.MotorOutput.NeutralMode = NeutralModeValue.Coast;
```
- **`NeutralMode = NeutralModeValue.Coast;`**  
  This sets the **neutral mode** of the motor to **Coast**. In **Coast mode**, when no power is applied, 
  the motor will freely rotate and slow down gradually. If set to **Brake mode**, the motor would resist movement and apply 
  braking to stop the motor more quickly.

  <Callout type={"info"} emoji={"ðŸ’¡"}>See an application of **Brake mode** on the ```Arm``` subsystem page.</Callout>

### Return the Configuration
```java
    return configs;
```
- Finally, the method returns the configured **`TalonFXConfiguration`** object. This object contains all the settings 
specified for the motor.



## ```setShootVelocityMotionMagic()``` Method

* Now, the Shooter motors are configured In order to run the wheels, the ```setShootVelocityMotionMagic()``` method was created, as seen below:
```java
public void setShootVelocityMotionMagic(double velocityTop, double velocityBottom) {
    motionMagic.Slot = 0;
    shooterTopMain.setControl(motionMagic.withVelocity(velocityTop));
    shooterBottomFollower.setControl(motionMagic.withVelocity(velocityBottom));
  }
```
### Code explanation

**```motionMagic.Slot = 0;```**
 * First, the code above sets the slot's gains that the motionMagic control uses. Because we have configured the talonFX motors to slot0, that is also the slot that 
 we use here.

 **```shooterTopMain.setControl(motionMagic.withVelocity(velocityTop));
    shooterBottomFollower.setControl(motionMagic.withVelocity(velocityBottom));```**

* Lastly, this code applies power to the motor using the ```setControl()``` method set to motion Magic using the velocity top and velocity bottom parameters. 

<Callout type = {"info"} emoji = {"ðŸ’¡"}>It is important to know that each ```TalonFX Configuration``` has its **own unique slot 0 values**. This means that when the motion magic
control set to slot 0 is set as the control of the two motors, each motor's configured slot 0 gains are used for the motion magic controller. In this case, those values are
the same for both motors, but in other applications, those values may be different.</Callout>
