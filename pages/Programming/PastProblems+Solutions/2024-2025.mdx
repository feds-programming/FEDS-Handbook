### Radio (VH-109) Does Not Connect to `http://radio.local/` When Configuring:

- Ensure you are connected to the radio through an ethernet cable to the DS port.
- Set a [Static IP Address](https://www.trendnet.com/press/resource-library/how-to-set-static-ip-address) with these parameters:

    - IP Address: 192.168.69.2

    - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

    - Gateway: Leave Blank

    - DNS: 192.168.69.1 or Leave Blank
- Make your way to `http://192.168.69.1/`
- After configuring the radio, make sure to refresh the page, then **Add a Suffix** so the radios' network can be differentiated from others.

### CAN Id on a REV Device Doesn't Save Upon a Robot Restart

- Make sure you press **`Burn Flash`** at the bottom of the configuration page once settings are all done. (Seems obvious but its easy to forget I swear)

### Using an updating value as a command parameter does not work

**Do Not** directly pass the updating value into the command as a parameter, as a command's constructor will only run once upon its original call (aka configureBindings() in most cases).
Instead, retrieve this updating value in the initialize() or execute() methods, as this will allow for a dynamically updating value instead of a one-time update to the variable.
