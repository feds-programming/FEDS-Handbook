# Intro to Java

### Introduction


Hi there, programmer! You have found your way to the programming section of the FEDS toolkit. We hope you will stay a while as we teach you about the basics of programming FRC robots, 
as well as more advanced topics to grow your knowledge. Whether you're just getting started with robot programming or you're looking to refine your skills and tackle more complex tasks, 
you're in the right place.

Throughout this guide, we'll walk you through the fundamentals of FRC robot programming, including how to set up your development environment, write your first commands, and test your code 
on the robot. As you progress, you'll learn about advanced topics such as vision integration, autonomous control, and optimizing robot behavior.

We’ve structured this documentation to be useful for all levels of experience. Beginners can start with the basics, while more experienced programmers can dive straight into more sophisticated 
concepts. Our goal is to help you succeed in building, programming, and troubleshooting your robot, as well as equipping you with the tools and techniques to innovate and push the boundaries
 of what’s possible on the FRC field.

So, let's get started! We’re excited to be part of your journey in FRC programming, and we can’t wait to see what you’ll create.
