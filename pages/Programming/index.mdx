# Welcome to FEDS 201 Programming SubGroup

{/* Write a Dexsctiprion on what a Programming Team will do, make it houmous and fun to read */}
Welcome to the FEDS 201 Programming SubGroup ‚Äî where ideas turn into logic, logic turns into code, and code turns into... well, a lot of Stack Overflow and Chief Dephi tabs. üß†üíª

We‚Äôre the team that lives somewhere between flowcharts and infinite `while(true)` loops. Whether it's debugging something that ‚Äúworked yesterday‚Äù or arguing over tabs vs. spaces (tabs, obviously), we thrive on building smart systems that actually do things.

<br />
<strong> What Do We Do Exactly?</strong> 

<p> We solve problems. We create tools. We build platforms, write scripts, design algorithms, and sometimes name our variables after obscure movie characters. Basically, if it involves code ‚Äî we‚Äôre in.</p>

We don‚Äôt just learn to program.

<p>We learn to think like engineers, dream like creators, and occasionally panic like developers at 11:59 PM.
So whether you're a seasoned coder or someone w ho just wrote your first `print("Hello World")` ‚Äî welcome. You're in the right place.</p>

### Our Programming Stats

<strong>What makes the FEDS 201 Programming SubGroup tick? </strong>Numbers, caffeine, and an unhealthy obsession with version control. Below are some stats that sum up who we are ‚Äî and yes, they‚Äôre all real (we wish we were kidding about the commit count).

<strong>Each number tells a story </strong>: of all-nighters before deadlines, of joyful bug squashing, and of those magical moments when the code actually works on the first try (rare, but legendary).

We‚Äôre not just counting lines of code. We‚Äôre counting passion, chaos, and surprisingly well-named variables.

## üß© FRC Wing vs Software Wing

At FEDS 201, our programming team is split into two mighty forces ‚Äî the FRC Wing and the Software Wing ‚Äî like two brain hemispheres working in perfect sync (most of the time).

The FRC Wing is all about precision, performance, and panic-proof code. They're the ones writing the core logic that makes the robot behave, react, and (hopefully) not explode. Think of them as the pilots of real-time systems ‚Äî fast, focused, and fluent in Java.

Meanwhile, the Software Wing is the quiet mastermind in the background, building the tools and platforms that give our team its strategic edge. From scouting apps to analytics dashboards to backend systems that probably deserve their own Netflix docuseries, this wing works year-round across a jungle of programming languages.

        "Multi-language stack"
      ]
    }
  }}
/>

<strong>In short:</strong>
- FRC Wing writes the code that executes the mission.
- Software Wing writes the code that wins the war.

Both are essential. Both are awesome. And yes ‚Äî you can be part of both. üòâ
