# Intake Overview

Intakes are in some way a part of every robot, which means there are many ways to go about designing and programming them. All intakes fall into two main categories: Over the bumper 
and under the bumper.

### Under the Bumper Intakes

when the size and shape of the game piece allows, Under the bumper intakes can be useful in several scenarios, especially when a robot is taking heavy hits from other things on the field.

### Over the Bumper Intakes

Over the bumper intakes are a good solution for many game challenges. They can add an extra bit of reach for a robot, or guide game pieces into a robots' frame.

### Programming an over the bumper intake

An over-the-bumper intake can use a variety of hardware, though it is typical for one to have:
 * A wrist turning motor
 * An intake turning motor
 * An encoder to track wrist movement
 * A sensor to detect when a game piece enters the intake

The next pages will detail how each of these hardwares can be programmed together to create a robust Intake subsystem.
