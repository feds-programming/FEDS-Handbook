Now, that you have installed VS Code, you will need to configure it to work with Git. This will allow you to make changes to the FEDS-Handbook and submit pull requests.

### Installing Extentions

Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window. This will open the Extensions view, where you can search for and install extensions.

#### Recommended Extensions

- **MDX**: This extension provides syntax highlighting and other editing features for MDX files.
- **Prettier**: This extension automatically formats your code to make it more readable.
- **MDX Preview**: This extension allows you to preview your MDX files in the editor.

These extensions will help you work with the FEDS-Handbook more efficiently.
