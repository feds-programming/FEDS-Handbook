    # Google Docs

    Since Google Docs is one of the most popular word processing tools, we will start by showing you how to convert your Google Docs Document to MDX.

    Its important to note that Google Docs does not support MDX, so you will need to convert your Google Docs Document to Markdown first, and then convert the Markdown file to MDX.



    <Steps>

    ### Create a Google Docs Document

    Write your content in the Google Docs Document, Use the Style window to format your content, and add images, links, and other media.
    Any other format other that the default will not be converted to MDX.

    ### Export your Google Docs Document to Markdown

    Go to `File` > `Download` > `Markdown (.md)`. This will download your Google Docs Document as a Markdown file.

    ### Convert your Markdown file to MDX

As we know, MDX (.mdx) is a superset of Markdown (.md), so you can copy the content of your Markdown file and paste it into a new MDX file. You can also use an online converter to convert your Markdown file to MDX.

    ### Publish your MDX file

Once you have converted your Markdown file to MDX, you can publish it to the FEDS201 ToolKit website. You can use the GitHub repository to create a pull request and add your MDX file to the repository.
