# Rochester High School Robotics (FRC 201)

## Team Handbook

REVISED 8/10/23 

### Introduction

Welcome to Team 201: The FEDS! We hope you will find your experience very rewarding and enjoyable. This guide is intended to give you and your parent/guardian an understanding of the program and the required responsibilities. In the following pages you will find information relating to team rules, expectations, and many other aspects of our team and FIRST.

As a FIRST Robotics member, you have an incredible opportunity to gain knowledge and share your enthusiasm while growing into future Business, Technology, and Engineering Leaders. You will participate in a life changing experience, and have the opportunity to learn many skills that will help you in your future, from networking with other teams and gaining sponsorships to designing and building a robot to our own specifications to working as a fully functional team with a varied group of people.

The success of Team 201 in robotics and its numerous other activities is due to the dedication of our members (this includes our Students, Mentors, and Parents) acting as a TEAM. Your participation is essential to fulfilling our program’s goals. Every member’s commitment and responsibility keeps our team running smoothly. The possibilities are only limited by your engagement and enthusiasm. We encourage you to have an abundance of both!

### Purpose Statement

The mission of the FEDS (201) is to inspire students to be STEM leaders through mentoring and innovation. The FIRST robotics program provides hands-on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) experience for our students centered on the FIRST Robotics Competition. The team will use this experience to provide students practical, technical, business and community relations experiences and to promote STEM within the school district as well as the community of Rochester/Rochester Hills.

### Joining the Team

All Rochester High School students are eligible to apply to Team 201. Members must submit an application. New students will participate in an interview in the Fall. Returning students will be interviewed at the end of the prior season in the Spring. Decisions about student groups/roles will be based on the prior year’s level of commitment, including special project hours, event attendance and dedication to the team. The new members will also need to submit an application and participate in an interview.

Due to the high costs of materials, registration, and other fees associated with robotics, each team member will contribute a participation fee of $250 to be paid at the mandatory Parent/Student Orientation, offered twice in September. The fee is payable by check made to Stem United or Venmo (@stemunited201). There is an additional club fee of $30 that should be paid directly to the school at the RCS enrichment website under RHS – Clubs. Students with financial hardship will not be prevented from participating and should contact Team 201’s teacher sponsor to express any concerns. In addition, students are each required to raise an additional $500 by December through fundraisers and/or sponsorship solicitation.

### FIRST Consent and Release forms (STIMS)

FIRST requires all youth team members to register as a member of a specific FIRST team via [www.firstinspires.org](http://www.firstinspires.org). The student will create a user account and provide the parent/guardian email address. Our team number is 201 and the program is FRC. The parent should receive an email to complete the registration and electronically sign the FIRST Consent and Release Form.

The full application form, with all orientation steps, can be found at [feds201.com](http://feds201.com) in the Application tab.

### What is FIRST?

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) was founded by inventor Dean Kamen to inspire young people’s interest and participation in science and technology. FIRST is volunteer-driven and built on partnerships with individuals, businesses, educational institutions, and government. Some of the world’s most respected companies provide funding, mentorship time, talent, and equipment to make FIRST’s mission a reality. Visit the website at [www.firstinspires.org](http://www.firstinspires.org). There are various levels within FIRST including Lego League Explorer (K-3 grades); Lego League Challenge (4-5th grades); FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC, 6-8th grade). These programs are high-tech spectator sports.

### FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition)

The FRC competOur team operates year-round. During the summer and fall, we conduct training, outreach activities, team building activities and fundraisers. ition season typically starts at the end of February and lasts for eight weeks. Team 201 will participate in a minimum of two Michigan District competitions during the regular season. Each year FRC unveils a new challenge at kickoff in January. High school students work with professional mentors to solve the engineering design problem and then join other teams in alliances to play the game at competition events where they are judged on design, innovation, and performance. Students learn teamwork, acquire technical skills, develop business acumen, and discover strengths they never knew they had. The program is a life-changing, career-molding experience and it’s a lot of fun. Be competitive and play hard on the field, but it is much, much more than a game.

### Gracious Professionalism (GP)

The FIRST organization is based on the principles of teamwork and the concept of gracious professionalism, which is part of the ethos of FIRST. It’s a way of doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community. With GP, fierce competition and mutual gain are not separate notions. Gracious professionals learn and compete like crazy, but treat one another with respect and kindness in the process. GP does not demand that our kindness be returned before we decide to give ours. The importance of GP is to better ourselves, rather than others, becoming responsible citizens and improving our society by example. Years from now our team alumni will remember a great play, some adversities overcome, helping out another team in need, but not so much the plastic trophies collecting dust.

### What We Do

Team 201 members participate in a number of technical and non-technical programs, as described below.

#### The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) and Build

**Build**

Season kickoff is in January on the first Saturday after New Year’s. This is when the new game for the season is revealed worldwide. Robot build season runs from January to March. The team will meet a minimum of 5 days a week, this includes: M-Th from 6:00 to 9:00pm (or later) and Saturday from 9:00am to 5:00 pm (or later). Lunch will be provided during Saturday meetings by the team.

**Competition**

Team 201 will participate in a minimum of two Michigan District competitions, typically held from Thursday evening through Saturday evening, with specific dates to be determined by December before. Some events run Friday/Saturday while others run Saturday/Sunday. If students will miss 1 day of school (for each event) to attend a district competition, this will be counted as a school-related excused absence as long as the student has met all team requirements to travel with the team. We rely on parent volunteer drivers (I-Chat approved) to provide transportation to District events.

Roughly, the top 160 teams that qualify, after District competitions, go to the Michigan State Championship (Saginaw, MI), typically the second week of April (which may coincide with Spring Break week). Students normally miss 2 days of school (school-related excused absence) if they attend the Michigan State Championships if it is not held during Spring Break week. Team members may be required to pay additional fees to cover registration and meals, depending on team fundraising outcomes.

Based on ranking points from the competition season, teams may then qualify for the FRC World Championship held in Houston, TX in late April. Students will miss 6-8 days of school if they attend the World Championships (school-related excused absence).

### Sub-teams

Team tasks are divided into different categories and assigned to the corresponding group or Special Project categories. Each sub-team is led by a student leader(s) and mentor who delegate work to its members. Students may participate in multiple sub-teams, as time and interest allows, but will often be designated as having a primary role while being required to complete 25 points worth of special projects. Tasks outside of the student’s primary role earn special project points. Satisfactory completion of these requirements inform good standing on the team, qualifying students to travel to competition.

**The functions of the various sub-teams are listed below:**

#### Technical Sub-Groups

**CAD/Design Group**

Responsible for designing the robot on the computer. Using the prototypes, they generate CAD (Computer-Aided Design) drawings for the fabrication group to manufacture parts which the mechanical team will use for the completed robot.

**Programming Group**

### Team Member in Good Standing

- All team members are expected to remain in ‘Good Standing’ on the team by adhering to the policies and guidelines outlined in this handbook and in the RCS Code of Conduct and the Acceptable Use Technology Agreement at all times.

**Team Member in Good Standing privileges:**

- Student is eligible for lead roles (if selected)
- Student is eligible for participation on the drive team or pit crew (if selected).
- Student is eligible to attend and be excused from school for competitions
- Earn recognition items such as a varsity letter at year end (note: 2 years of good standing required for varsity letter)

### Team 201 will utilize a 3-warning policy as follows:

**Warnings are defined as:**

- Failure to meet team attendance expectations
- Failure to pay team fee without making alternate arrangements (each month past due date is considered a strike)
- Failure to meet individual fundraising expectation (each month past due date is considered a strike)
- Failure to act safely (consistent negligence or single major offense)
- Behavior or engagement inconsistent with the RCS Code of Conduct and/or the Acceptable Use for Technology Agreement.

**Warning One:** A written notice of warning will be issued to the student member and parents. The student will remain in good standing with the team.

**Warning Two:** The student will not be in ‘Good Standing’ with the team, and will lose associated privileges. (A written notice will be sent to both the student and parents.)

**Warning Three:** The student shall be removed from the team. (A written notice will be sent to both the student and parents.)

### Return to good standing:

The first warning can be eliminated by 2 consecutive months of ‘Good Standing Performance’ following warning one. (Full payment of team fee will immediately remove a ‘failure to pay’ warning).

A **student with two warnings** will need to submit an essay to the Coach/Teacher Sponsor. The essay shall be an explanation of why the student should be returned to good standing status. If the Coach/Teacher Sponsor accepts the explanation, the student will be returned to good standing, but still has one warning.

A student that has **received a 3rd warning** will be removed from the team. The student may reapply to join the team the following year, but there is no guarantee that membership will be granted. There will be no refund of team fees already paid.

Note: Warnings will be tracked by the Lead Mentor I and II, along with School Administrators.

### Selection of Student Leads: Criteria, Roles and Responsibilities

The Operating Committee will vote to determine which students will be selected as leads of sub-groups. This will be based on student interest as indicated in their exit surveys and end-of-season interviews, experience and their demonstration of the following criteria.

- Attend mandatory leadership training (will be offered by mentors in the summer).
- Attend 90% of all Team Meetings. Coordinate a representative from your sub-group when you cannot attend.
- Provide information/documentation to the Awards team when requested.
- Work with your mentor to create and execute a pre-season, basic training plan so that newer students can contribute during build season.
- Document subgroup training plans and outcomes.
- Ensure your sub-team completes documentation and keeps it organized, throughout the season such as:
  - Photos
  - Current challenge design documents, and work log
  - Book of Knowledge (generic knowledge of the sub-team)
- Encourage your subteam to demonstrate FEDS values. Participate in outreach, both fundraising and mentoring, attend meetings on time, be prepared, etc. Be an example worth following.

### Be an expert in your area of leadership

- Work with your mentor to determine day to day activities for the sub-team
- Be the primary support/decision maker during idea generation and prototyping.
- Guide newer team members in gaining skills and experience. Help them remain engaged in the sub-team and feel useful.
- Know who the experts are in your sub-team
  - Use them to train and guide less experienced students
  - Leverage their help for difficult tasks
- Check in with your team members frequently. Know what they are working on. Show interest in their work. Guide them if they are struggling. Keep them busy.
- Complete work on time, or alert mentor/other team leads if you cannot.
- Be reliable. Attend 90% of build days. On the days you cannot attend, give notice and provide a representative from your team with enough information to be useful in your absence.
- Ensure that your sub-team follows safety rules and cleans their workspace at the end of each build day.
- Lead by example.
- Report out the progress of the sub-team at the end of each build day.

### Safety

In order to run any successful business or team, a high level of safety must be observed, practiced, and maintained. The following rules are designed to ensure the safety of students, mentors, and any visitors to the Rochester High School Shop Area where Team 201 is based.

- Safety glasses must be worn at all times in the shop and while working on the robot and its components, and in the pits at competition.
- Horseplay will not be allowed at any time.
- Members will be trained and certified by a mentor before using machinery independently.
- All equipment will be handled with extreme care and caution.
- Work areas will be kept neat and orderly.
- Appropriate footwear with fully enclosed shoes (no sandals or flip flops) must be worn in the shop and at competition.
- Hair will be tied back while operating any equipment or standing near equipment that is in operation.
- No loose clothing is to be worn while operating equipment or standing near equipment that is in operation.
- No food or drink near any equipment.
- Equipment, tools, and supplies must be put away every night and work areas must be left clean.

### Parent/Guardian Responsibilities

Parents/guardians are encouraged to become team mentors (technical or non-technical). The effort is more than rewarded with the experience of helping young minds grow, and the program runs entirely with volunteer mentors. No mentors = no robotics team. The parents/guardians of the students are an important part of the success of the team.

**Our team needs actively engaged mentors in the following areas:**

- Programming
- Electrical
- Mechanical
- Machining
- CAD Design
- Videography/Editing
- Photography
- Business Planning
- Branding/Marketing
- Website Design
- Social Media
- Safety
- Meal Planning

Whether you engage as a mentor or a volunteer, you fill a vital role to make this team possible.

**Generally, each student’s parent/guardian is expected to sign up for a minimum of 4 volunteer slots throughout a season.**

**Additional parent responsibilities include:**

- Attend parent meetings
- Make sure students are on time for meetings, build times, and events.
- Timely transportation must also be provided home afterwards. Please be respectful of our volunteer mentors’ time by picking up students on time.
- Sign and return permission slips, waiver forms and other required documents by designated due date.
- Provide telephone numbers where they can be reached in an emergency.
- Provide and monitor a dependable email address to receive team correspondence.
- Parents/guardians are responsible for the conduct of their child.
- Parents/guardians are encouraged to attend all events and provide support for the team.
- Parents/guardians are encouraged to keep up-to-date with what their child is working on with the team and the progress that the team has made.
- Parents/guardians are encouraged to become team mentors (technical or non-technical), which adds additional responsibilities but is a very rewarding experience.
- Notify the team when students will be absent from a team event where they are expected.

### Competition Protocol

**Participation**

It is expected that you fulfill your duties as a team member in the role you have agreed to and in any supporting role you can to assist the current needs of the team. **Attending competition is a privilege, not a right.** Since these events cause students to miss class time, students are expected to remain involved at competition in team related activities (competition, video, photography, pits, scouting, cheering, presentations, etc.). Students not involved in the pits, field activities, or presentations should remain in the stands with the team.

- **Participation in competitions is a lot of fun and encouraged.** If you will not be participating in a competition, please let the lead mentor know as soon as possible so that the team can allocate competition duties efficiently and effectively.
- Team members attending the competitions are required to attend the whole competition. While at competitions, students are expected to perform their assigned duties. Team members are required to remain with the team throughout the entire competition. Failure to do so will result in ineligibility to attend future competitions.
- Students shall keep their adult mentors informed of their specific activities and whereabouts at all times. Students may not use their own cars or ride in cars belonging to other students during the competition. The buddy system will be strictly enforced. Students must always be with their partner. Students must not be alone at any time.
- Uniforms are to be worn at all times during competition and not be covered by other non team apparel.
- Approved eye protection must be worn at all times by all team members and their guests while in the pit areas.
- Students may be responsible for their meals at competitions.
- Because travel is required to and from competitions, students not on the official roster for a competition must be accompanied by their parent if they wish to attend the event. Students not on the official roster must not interfere with or interrupt team activities. If they do so, they will be asked to leave and they will jeopardize their future team travel opportunities.

**Room/Hotel Behavior**

- Attendants are guests using the facilities, special care should be taken to not deface or destroy any property. Individuals, who inflict damage to the hotel rooms or the building, will be held liable for any costs incurred for repair.
- Curfew regulations shall be interpreted to mean that each person shall be in his/her hotel room by the published curfew. No team activities will occur after curfew. Room checks will be made nightly by mentors. Once a room check is made, students may not leave their room. Each student shall remain in his/her room until a predetermined time the next morning. Each student will be given the room number and phone number of the mentor(s) to call in case a problem arises during the night.
- Students of the opposite gender are **NOT ALLOWED** to enter each other’s room. When possible, we will have a designated room where students can socialize, play cards or watch movies together, while being supervised by a mentor or adult chaperone.
- Students are expected to be respectful and considerate of hotel roommates when traveling. Students should communicate with each other to reach consensus on sharing the restroom and quiet times.
- Only people who are on the official team travel roster may be in a team hotel room. Students from other teams, friends or RCS students who are not on the travel roster may not be in the team rooms.
- Mentors are responsible for taking all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of their students and must be readily available in case of an emergency.
- It is agreed that, upon violation of the RCS Code of Conduct and the Acceptable Use for Technology Agreement, the violators’ parents will be notified. And the violator will be sent home at their parents’ expense. Students violating the Code of Conduct at FIRST competitions will be disqualified from competitive awards.
- Serious misconduct shall be reported to the mentor, teacher sponsor, principal, parents, and if necessary, the proper authorities. Any further disciplinary action will be determined by the school administration and may result in at least one calendar year of ineligibility.

### Cheering

Gracious professionalism comes into play strongly when we’re in the stands rooting on our team as well as others. We want all the students on all the teams to do well, to feel good about themselves, and to be inspired by the competition. We are supportive and positive at all times under every adverse condition. Demonstrate by example what good sportsmanship is.

### Awards

We will stay until the end of the awards ceremonies. During the ceremony we will applaud the teams that are winning awards. When we applaud we will stand to show our respect for what they have accomplished. During the awards ceremony of competitions, all Members are expected to be in the stands to support their team, with exception of the drive team and pit crew.

### Event Volunteers

In addition to our team’s volunteer needs, FIRST competition events are run solely by volunteers. Each FRC team is expected to provide a **minimum of two volunteers to each event** we participate in. These volunteer opportunities are facilitated through the FIRST in Michigan organization directly. The volunteer jobs do not require any prior knowledge of FIRST robotics. Please consider volunteering your time. In January of the current season, volunteer information can be found here.

### Safety at Competitions

Safety should be practiced at all times. **Safety glasses must be worn in the pits by all members – students and adults.**

### How Parents Participate

### Additional Reasons to Become Involved in the Robotics Program: College & Career Opportunities

The FEDS FIRST program is an excellent way to explore careers of engineering, communication, creative design, marketing and many other technical areas. During this program, students will be exposed to many principles of engineering, marketing, and various mentoring skills of professionals. We recognize the possibility that not all students will go on to careers in engineering. It is our goal, however, to expose all the students to technological careers including but not limited to engineering.

### Scholarship Opportunities

FIRST offers over $80 million in scholarship opportunities to team members annually. While many of the scholarships are designed for those seeking degrees in engineering, math, and science, there are many that are available for any area of study. The FIRST website (www.firstinspires.org) has a complete listing and additional information.
