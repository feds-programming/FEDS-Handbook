## 🦾 Chapter 1: Intake Methodologies

**The Goal:** Reliable acquisition. You should be able to drive past a game piece at full speed and pick it up without stopping.

### Types & Geometry

<GenericGrid layout="responsive" columns={{ xs: 1, sm: 2 }} gap="16px" items={[
    { title: "Slapdown / Pivoting", icon: "👋", description: "A rigid arm that pivots out to grab the piece. Classic, effective, but vulnerable to damage." },
    { title: "Under-the-Bumper (UTB)", icon: "🚗", description: "The intake is hidden inside the frame. Protected, fast, but requires a specific chassis cutout. (See: 118 in 2024)." }
]}
    renderItem={(item) => <ModernCard {...item} variant="outlined" size="sm" />}
/>

### Materials: The Soft Touch
*   **Rigid Intakes** (Polycarb/Aluminum) are for **Compliant Game Pieces** (Foam balls, inflated cubes).
*   **Compliant Intakes** (Rubber wheels, flex tubing) are for **Rigid Game Pieces** (Hard plastic cones).
*   *Opposites attract!*

## 🔄 Chapter 2: Indexing & Handoffs

Once you have it, where does it go? The **Indexer** is the waiting room for game pieces.

### Case Studies in Flow

<GenericTimeline orientation="vertical" variant="cards" items={[
    { title: "With Indexer (254 in 2022)", description: "Used a 'serializer' to organize balls into a single file line before feeding the shooter. Order from chaos.", icon: "1️⃣", date: "Serialized" },
    { title: "Without Indexer (118 in 2023)", description: "A pivoting intake that handed off DIRECTLY to the end effector. Fast, but requires insane precision.", icon: "⚡", date: "Direct" }
]}
/>

### CAD Highlight: The 4-Bar Linkage
**The Problem:** How do I deploy an intake outside the frame but pack it inside for the start of the match?
**The Solution:** The 4-Bar Linkage.
*   Use geometric constraints in sketches to simulate the motion.
*   Ensure it stays within the "Frame Perimeter" when retracted.

**Remember: An intake that jams is worse than no intake at all.** 🚫

    **Pro Tip**: "Vectoring" wheels (mecanum wheels) can center a game piece automatically. It's like magic, but it's just physics.
