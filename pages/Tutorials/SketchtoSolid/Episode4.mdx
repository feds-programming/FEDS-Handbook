## 👐 Chapter 1: End Effectors (Shooters & Placers)

### Analysis of Greatness

<GenericGrid layout="responsive" columns={{ xs: 1, sm: 2 }} gap="16px" items={[
    { title: "Single Game Piece", icon: "1️⃣", description: "254 (2022): Turret + Adjustable Hood. Optimized for one thing: Shooting fast and accurate." },
    { title: "Dual Purpose", icon: "2️⃣", description: "118 (2019): Controlling two different objects (Hatch & Cargo) with shared wheels. A masterpiece of packaging." }
]}
    renderItem={(item) => <ModernCard {...item} variant="outlined" size="sm" />}
/>

### Movement Methods: Getting to the Goal
*   **Elevators**: Continuous vs. Cascade rigging. Great for going straight up. Heavy.
*   **Arms**: Telescoping or Pivoting. Great for reaching out. Complex geometry.
*   **The Combo**: The "Elevator w/ pivoting mech" (Reefscape style) vs. the "Pivoting Elevator" (1323 style).

---

## 🧗 Chapter 2: Endgame Deep Dive

**Objective:** Hanging, climbing, or balancing. This is usually the last 20 seconds of the match.

### Mechanisms of Ascent
*   **Winches**: Simple, strong, slow.
*   **Telescoping Arms**: Fast, reach high, pull up.
*   **Pneumatics**: Bang-bang. Up and down.

<Callout type="error" emoji="💀">
    **Epic Fails**: We discuss locking mechanisms (ratchets, friction brakes) because falling down after the buzzer sounds is the saddest sound in FRC.
</Callout>

### Activity: The "Dual-Purpose" Challenge
**Task:** Whiteboard a mechanism that can BOTH intake a game piece AND score it.
*Examples:* 2022 Everybot intake/scorer, 2025 L1 manipulators.
*Goal:* Efficiency. Why build two things when one thing do trick?

    **Pro Tip**: Always design a "hard stop" for your mechanisms. If the software fails (and it will), the hardware shouldn't break.
