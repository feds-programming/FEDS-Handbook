## 🖥️ Chapter 1: The Digital Workshop (Onshape Basics)

### The Workflow
Onshape is our digital playground. It has two main modes:

1.  **Part Studios**: Where you model custom parts. Think of this as the machine shop.
2.  **Assemblies**: Where you bring parts together. Think of this as the assembly pit.

### The Holy Trinity of Shortcuts
Memorize these. Your mouse hand will thank you.

<GenericGrid layout="responsive" columns={{ xs: 1, sm: 3 }} gap="16px" items={[
    { title: "Sketch", icon: "✏️", description: "Shift + S" },
    { title: "Extrude", icon: "⬆️", description: "Shift + E" },
    { title: "Revolve", icon: "🔄", description: "Shift + W" }
]}
    renderItem={(item) => <ModernCard {...item} variant="outlined" size="sm" />}
/>

### Activity: The "Ball with a Square Hole"
**Challenge:** Create a shaft, a sphere, and mate them using a "Fastened Mate" to lock them relative to each other.
*Goal:* Understand how parts interact in 3D space.

## 🏎️ Chapter 2: Things That Go 'Round & 'Round

### Motors: The Heart of the Robot
We use **Brushless** motors because they are efficient and powerful.

*   **Krakens (X60, X44)**: The heavy hitters.
*   **Minions**: Small but mighty.
*   **NEOs**: The reliable standard.

### Shafts & Bearings
**Why 1/2" Hex?**
Because round shafts slip. Hex shafts lock. **Hexagons are the bestagons.**

**Bearings:**
They hold the shaft in place but allow it to spin. Without them, you're just drilling a hole in metal and hoping for the best (spoiler: it melts).

## ⚙️ Chapter 3: Power Transmission Deep Dive

How do we get power from the motor to the wheel/arm/shooter?

<GenericTimeline orientation="vertical" variant="cards" items={[
    { title: "Gears", description: "Transmitting motion between axles. Tangent gears reverse direction. Different sizes change speed (Ratio Math).", icon: "⚙️", date: "Precision" },
    { title: "Belts & Pulleys", description: "Using the HTD 5M profile. Great for transferring motion over distances. Smooth and quiet.", icon: "🎗️", date: "Distance" },
    { title: "Chains & Sprockets", description: "The heavy lifters (#25 vs #35 chain). Used for high-load pivots and places where belts might skip.", icon: "⛓️", date: "Strength" }
]}
/>

### Action Item: "Will the box lid open?"
**Puzzle:** Trace the direction of motion through a complex diagram of gears and belts.
*Hint:* Every gear mesh reverses direction. Count the meshes!

    **Design Tip**: Always design with maintenance in mind. If you can't reach the bolt to tighten it, neither can the pit crew during a timeout!
