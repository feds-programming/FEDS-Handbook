## 🧠 Chapter 1: The Philosophy of Winning

### Quality over Quantity
It is better to do **one thing perfectly** than to do everything poorly. A robot that only climbs but does it 100% of the time is better than a robot that shoots, climbs, and spins plates but fails 50% of the time.

### Game Analysis: A History Lesson
We look at the past to predict the future.

    { title: "Reefscape (2025)", description: "The current challenge. What are the scoring objectives?", icon: "🌊", date: "Current" }

## 🏎️ Chapter 2: The Base of Everything (Chassis)

The chassis is not just wheels. It houses the **Central Electrical Hub** (Battery, PDH, RoboRio) and localization sensors (Limelights). If the chassis fails, the robot is a brick.

### Choose Your Fighter

    { title: "Swerve Drive", icon: "🦀", description: "'360 no-scope.' Independent rotation and drive for every wheel. Omni-directional movement. The 'Meta'." }
]}
    renderItem={(item) => <ModernCard {...item} variant="outlined" size="sm" />}

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    **Note on Swerve**: It's complex and expensive. But once you have it, you never go back. (See: 2025 'Stingray' chassis with upside-down electronics).
</Callout>

### Activity: "Strategic Design Practice"
**Scenario:** You are playing "Hero Heist" (or a mock game).
**Task:** List the **Needs** (Must do), **Wants** (Nice to have), and **Won'ts** (Don't even try) for your robot.
*Goal:* Learn to prioritize features based on points per second.
